## The Core Idea in One Sentence

**A honeytoken is bait that has no legitimate reason to be touched — so if anyone touches it, you know something is wrong.**

Unlike detection systems that try to distinguish attacker behavior from normal behavior (hard), honeytokens work because a real user has zero reason to click a file called `passwords_backup.kdbx` they've never seen before, or log into an AWS account they don't know exists. Any interaction is, by definition, malicious or mistaken.

In the post-Mythos landscape, honeytokens matter more than before. AI-assisted attackers move at machine speed and often operate via automated agents — which scan, enumerate, and exfiltrate indiscriminately. Machine-speed attackers are much more likely to trip deception bait than careful human attackers.

## What a Good Honeytoken Program Looks Like

| Layer | Example Bait | If Tripped, It Means |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **File system** | `customer_database_backup.csv` on a shared drive | Someone is browsing shares they shouldn't |
| **Cloud storage** | A canary AWS access key in `~/.aws/credentials` | Credential theft on a developer workstation |
| **Directory/AD** | A fake "Domain Admin" account that no one ever logs into | Domain enumeration and credential-attack attempts |
| **Email** | A fake internal contact list including bait addresses | Email system compromise or data exfiltration |
| **Code repos** | A committed-then-quickly-deleted API key (rotated before commit) | Repo cloning and secret-scanning by attackers |
| **Database** | A row with fake PII tied to a specific identifier | Data-exfiltration queries |
| **Web app** | A hidden admin URL that returns a canary | Attacker reconnaissance |

The test of a good honeytoken: **would a normal user, or a normal internal script, ever touch this?** If yes, it's not a honeytoken — it's a false-positive factory.

## Free Tools to Start Today

### Thinkst Canarytokens (Free Tier)

**URL:** https://www.canarytokens.org

The easiest on-ramp. Free. Hosted by Thinkst Labs (the people who built Canary). No signup required.

Token types it generates:
- DNS canaries (alerts when a specific DNS name is looked up)
- AWS API keys (alerts when the key is used anywhere)
- Microsoft Word / Excel / PDF docs (alerts when opened)
- Web bug URLs (alerts when visited)
- MySQL / SQL Server dump files (alerts when imported)
- Slow redirect URLs
- Cloned website alerts
- Kubernetes config
- Azure login certificates

**Setup time:** ~10 minutes per token. You get an email or webhook alert when tripped.

### Thinkst Canary (Paid — for organizations that can spend)

**URL:** https://canary.tools

A physical or virtual appliance that impersonates a whole fake server (Windows file server, Linux SSH, router, network share). Attackers scanning your network find it first and trip alerts. ~$7,500/year minimum. Worth it for organizations with real sensitive data.

### DNS Canary via Your Own Domain (Free, DIY)

If you own a domain, you can build DIY DNS canaries:
1. Create a subdomain like `finance-backups.[yourdomain].com`
2. Point it at a server that logs any DNS lookup
3. Any lookup = someone is probing or has enumerated your DNS

## Starter Honeytoken Deployment (for an SMB)

You can deploy a meaningful starter set in an afternoon. In priority order:

### 1. Credential honeytoken in your password manager (10 minutes)
Create a fake banking entry named something like "First National — Ops Account" in Bitwarden/1Password. If anyone ever accesses it, they've compromised your password manager. Set up an alert on the vault entry.

### 2. Canary AWS key on your bookkeeper's workstation (15 minutes)
Generate a Canarytokens AWS key. Save it to `C:\Users\[bookkeeper]\.aws\credentials` (Windows) or `~/.aws/credentials` (Mac). If anyone uses that key, your bookkeeper's machine is compromised.

### 3. Canary document on your shared drive (10 minutes)
Create a Word doc named `Q1 2026 Payroll Backup — DO NOT DELETE.docx` using Canarytokens. Upload to the same shared folder as real payroll data. Anyone browsing the share and opening files they shouldn't trips the alert.

### 4. Fake AD admin account (30 minutes, if you have Active Directory)
Create `svc_backup_admin` or similar. Grant Domain Admin. Set a 100-character random password. Enable auditing on the account. Never use it. Any login attempt is a red alert.

### 5. Canary in your customer database (30 minutes)
Insert a row with a fake customer named something like "Alexandra Ziegler" with a unique, distinctive email. Set an alert that fires if that email address is ever queried against external services (HIBP, spam databases) — it means your database was exfiltrated.

## Rules for Honeytokens That Actually Work

1. **Make them plausible.** A file named `hackme.txt` will be ignored. A file named `2026_Q1_payroll_final.xlsx` placed where real payroll lives will not.
2. **Make them irresistible to automated tooling.** AI-assisted attacker agents scan for `.env`, `credentials`, `backup`, `database`, `payroll`, `admin`, `keys`, `secrets`. Use those names.
3. **Put them where real data is.** A canary on an isolated honeypot network catches nothing. A canary alongside real data catches everything.
4. **Tell no one except the response lead.** Honeytoken effectiveness degrades as awareness spreads. Keep the list in a sealed document, not in the company wiki.
5. **Test the alert path once a quarter.** A silent canary is worse than no canary.
6. **Treat any trip as a P1 incident until proven otherwise.** Don't downgrade "probably a curious employee" without investigation. The whole point of honeytokens is that the trip itself is high-signal.

## What Honeytokens Do NOT Replace

- **Perimeter security** (firewall, EDR, patching) — honeytokens detect late-stage compromise
- **Backups** — honeytokens don't recover data, they just tell you data was touched
- **Incident response plans** — when a canary trips, you need a playbook ready
- **MFA** — honeytokens catch attackers who are already in; MFA keeps them out

Think of honeytokens as the smoke detectors of your security program. You still need the fire extinguisher and the escape route.

## Named Example: What a Canary Would Have Caught at Vercel *(added in v1.6.0)*

On April 19, 2026, Vercel disclosed that attackers pivoted through a compromised third-party AI tool (Context.ai) into a Vercel employee's Google Workspace, then into Vercel internal systems, and enumerated customer environment variables that were not marked "sensitive." Vercel's own monitoring did not catch the pivot because the attacker activity looked like legitimate employee activity.

**What a well-placed honeytoken would have done:**

A canary environment variable named something like `INTERNAL_PROD_DB_URL` or `LEGACY_ADMIN_TOKEN` — placed on a representative Vercel project, wired to a Canarytokens DNS trigger or HTTP canary — would have fired the instant the attacker enumerated environment variables. That is exactly the operation the attacker performed to exfiltrate secrets. A canary would have alerted within seconds.

**Why this works:** the attacker does not know which variables are real and which are bait. Automated agentic attackers — and increasingly human attackers relying on LLM assistance — tend to dump everything and sort later. Bait dumps into the exfil pile just like real data, and the trip fires.

**Takeaway:** For any platform where you store environment variables or secrets in cloud panels (Vercel, Railway, Fly, Render, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, GitHub Codespaces secrets), plant at least one canary env var per project. It is free, takes 10 minutes, and is one of the only controls that fires on exactly the right action.

## Why This Matters More After Mythos

Three specific post-Mythos reasons to deploy honeytokens this quarter:

1. **Automated agentic attackers scan aggressively.** AI-driven attack agents (documented in April 2026 Picus research: 2,500 orgs compromised in under an hour via one LLM attack chain) are not careful. They scan fast, enumerate shares, and dump credentials. They will trip honeytokens.

2. **The discovery-to-exploitation window collapsed.** You do not have time to retrofit detection after an attacker is already in. Honeytokens deployed today detect tomorrow's attack.

3. **SANS Priority Action PA9 calls for it explicitly.** Industry consensus now treats deception as a required capability, not an optional one. See [docs/17-industry-consensus-framework.md](17-industry-consensus-framework.md) for the full framework.

## A 90-Day Deception Capability Plan

| Week | Action | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Deploy 5 free Canarytokens (credential, AWS key, Word doc, DNS, web bug) | Free |
| 2 | Document alert escalation path; test every token | Free |
| 3-4 | Add one AD honey-account (if applicable) and one database canary row | Free, ~2 hours labor |
| 5-8 | Identify 3 places normal users never reach; place a canary in each | Free |
| 9-10 | Review trip log; retire any false-positive-prone tokens; replace with better bait | Free |
| 11-12 | If budget allows, evaluate Thinkst Canary appliance or equivalent | $7.5K/year if purchased |

By day 90 you should have ~10 active honeytokens covering credentials, files, network, database, and cloud — for under $100 out-of-pocket and <10 hours of labor.
