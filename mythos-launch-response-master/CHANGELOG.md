# Changelog

All notable updates to this project.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-22 (April 19-22 intel refresh + Next.js/Vercel stack guide upgrade)

### Added
- **stacks/nextjs-vercel.md** — Substantial upgrade to integrate the operational lessons the Vercel/Context.ai breach taught. New sections on the `sensitive` vs. `encrypted` env-var distinction (the single control that worked), a concrete audit workflow using GitGuardian's `ggshield` against `vercel env pull` output, the `sk_live_*` in preview/dev footgun, OAuth and third-party integration hygiene referencing doc 12's four-channel vendor check, and long-term secret-manager options (Doppler / Infisical / 1Password / HashiCorp Vault).
- **docs/12-supply-chain-safety.md** — New "April 20-22 investigation updates" subsection capturing the follow-up findings Vercel released after initial disclosure: Lumma Stealer patient zero (Context.ai employee, Feb 2026 Roblox auto-farm script), npm packages confirmed NOT compromised, pre-existing customer compromises found independently of the Context.ai chain (validates "assume prior compromise" posture), Enterprise Bedrock deployments unaffected, ShinyHunters denial, and early downstream key abuse signal (OpenAI leaked-key notification to a customer nine days before disclosure). Explicit framing added that industry consensus treats this as an OAuth supply-chain incident with AI-acceleration as footnote, not a Mythos-era pivot.
- **docs/07-sources-and-references.md** — New "Vercel Breach Follow-Ups (Added April 22, 2026)" category with 13 new sources including the CSA Research Note, GitGuardian incident playbook, SpecterOps identity-attack-path analysis, SANS follow-up blog, Context.ai security update, Trend Micro / Obsidian Security / VentureBeat analyst coverage, and the CyberAgents VulnOps Playbook. Plus new "Known Exploited Vulnerabilities — April 19-22 Window" table (CVE-2026-33825 "BlueHammer" Defender EoP, CVE-2026-20133 Cisco, others). Total sources now 80+.

### Context
Research pass covered April 19-22, 2026. Four parallel research threads: Anthropic/Glasswing/Vercel follow-ups, new CVEs/KEV/regulatory, expert commentary post-Vercel, post-SANS-webcast framework updates. Explicit "nothing new" findings where applicable:

- **No new Glasswing partners** announced publicly
- **No Anthropic policy changes** beyond the April 16 Opus 4.7 + Cyber Verification Program launch
- **No Stamos revision** to the October 2026 open-weight parity estimate
- **No open-weight model release** claiming Mythos-class autonomous vulnerability discovery (OpenMythos released Apr 19 is a 770M architecture reconstruction, not a capability-parity claim)
- **No second SaaS victim** publicly disclosed with a parallel OAuth compromise
- **No U.S. government statement** specific to Vercel (CISA, SEC, Treasury, White House all silent — Vercel is privately held, reducing 8-K obligation)
- **No cyber insurance exclusion** triggered by Vercel (Fitch's April 16 warning remains prospective)
- **No Big 4 / AICPA / IAASB** position paper tied to Vercel
- **No Schneier, Stamos, AISLE, Hunt, Krebs, Goodin, Zetter, Stratechery, Lawfare** post specifically on Vercel in the April 19-22 window

The emerging consensus: **Vercel is a proof-point for defensive advice that already existed, not a reason to change strategy**. The defensive actions (OAuth scope audit, `sensitive` flag on env vars, secret manager migration, secret rotation, treat AI SaaS as high-risk third-party) were all in the repo before April 19. This release refines their presentation rather than reversing them.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-19 (Vercel/Context.ai supply-chain breach case-study release)

### Added
- **Supply Chain Safety (doc 12)** — Integrated the April 19 Vercel breach as a named real-world case study alongside the March 31 trojanized Claude Code forks incident. Full attack chain, scope, Mandiant engagement, attacker characterization, and Mythos non-attribution. New "Four-Channel Vendor Check" section covering DNS/firewall, browser, email, and identity-provider audit logs as the practical check before authorizing any new AI tool.
- **Industry Consensus Framework (doc 17)** — New "Live Case Study: The April 19 Vercel Breach" section mapping the incident to Priority Actions PA3 (Defend Your Agents) and PA7 (Inventory and Reduce Attack Surface). Adds "framework-to-implementation gap" synthesis tying the breach to the VulnOps (PA11) argument.
- **Honeytokens and Deception (doc 18)** — New "Named Example: What a Canary Would Have Caught at Vercel" section showing that a canary environment variable wired to a Canarytokens DNS trigger would have fired at the exact moment the attacker enumerated env vars — one of the few controls that fires on precisely the right action.
- **Intelligence Brief (doc 00) §7.5** — Added April 19 Vercel breach paragraph with explicit "NOT attributed to Mythos" framing and cross-reference to doc 12.
- **Sources and References (doc 07)** — New "Supply-Chain Incidents" category with 7 sources covering the Vercel breach (primary bulletin, BleepingComputer, CyberInsider, iTnews, Cryptopolitan, Startup Fortune, Hacker News discussion).
- **README Key Dates** — Added April 19, 2026 Vercel breach entry.

### Context
The Vercel incident — disclosed the morning of April 19 with full attack-origin detail by evening — is the clearest real-world validation to date of the AI-tool-supply-chain attack class this repo addresses. A third-party AI tool (Context.ai) was compromised; its OAuth integration to a Vercel employee's Google Workspace was used to pivot into Vercel internal systems; a "limited subset" of customer credentials and non-sensitive environment variables were exfiltrated. The "sensitive" flag on env vars (encrypted at rest) was the single control that worked.

**Attribution:** Vercel's bulletin makes no reference to Mythos or Glasswing. The attacker was characterized by Vercel as "highly sophisticated" but the attack class is conventional supply-chain OAuth abuse, not Mythos-enabled autonomous discovery. The significance for this repo is not that it proves Mythos is being used in attacks — it isn't — but that it is the clearest near-term argument for implementing the SANS/CSA 11 priority actions **now**, because the attacker class executing these attacks is already operating at a sophisticated level even without frontier-model assistance.

**Response-plan implications:**
- Doc 12's four-channel vendor check is now the operational recommendation for every organization before authorizing a new AI-tool OAuth integration.
- Doc 18's canary-env-var pattern is now one of the few controls that measurably would have caught the Vercel attack class.
- Doc 17's "framework-to-implementation gap" is illustrated by a specific timeline: SANS/CSA framework published April 14; Vercel was already compromised pre-April 19. The framework works only if deployed.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-17 (third refresh — gap-closing release)

### Added
- **NEW DOC: [18-honeytokens-deception.md](docs/18-honeytokens-deception.md)** — Maps directly to SANS Priority Action PA9 (Build a Deception Capability, next 90 days). Free-tool deployment guide (Thinkst Canarytokens, DIY DNS canaries). 5-honeytoken starter set for an SMB, deployable in an afternoon. 90-day deployment plan under $100. Rules for honeytokens that actually work. Why this matters more after Mythos (automated agentic attackers are more likely to trip canaries than careful human attackers). Closes the last major gap from the April 14 SANS/CSA framework.
- **SMB Response Plan §10 "How This Maps to Industry Consensus"** — Explicit cross-reference table collapsing the 11 SANS priority actions into five practical SMB moves, each linking to the relevant section of this plan or other repo doc. Tells a reader exactly where to go for each industry-mandated capability.

### Changed
- **Day Zero Playbook** — Philosophy section rewritten to acknowledge three realistic access paths: Opus 4.7 + Cyber Verification Program (most likely for SMBs), Glasswing partner access, or direct Mythos Preview invitation. Hacktron $2,283 Chrome exploit cited as evidence the capability is real even with generally-available models.
- **Mythos Prompt Series** — New "Which Model Should You Run These Against?" section clarifying the prompts are model-agnostic and work with Mythos, Opus 4.7 (via CVP), or Opus 4.6 — with fewer findings at lower tiers but real findings. Cross-references SANS AI-is-good-at list. Notes that Opus 4.7 blocks high-risk requests outside the CVP by default.
- **README** — Total file count updated (66 → 67), documentation count updated (19 → 21 reflecting docs 17 and 18), total lines updated (8,500+ → 8,800+). Document index extended with entry 18.
- **ROADMAP** — Full restructure: "Completed" section now reflects v1.5.0 reality (all intelligence integrations, industry framework, honeytokens). New "Near-Term Research and Intelligence" section with seven specific signals to monitor. Next content priorities clarified (Node.js, Python, healthcare/financial/legal addenda, translations).

### Known Gaps Still Open
- Claude Code skill (`skill/`) has not yet been updated to load docs 17 and 18. Next skill-release cycle.
- Day Zero Playbook references Opus 4.7/CVP in philosophy but doesn't yet rewrite the four Red Team scaffold prompts for non-Mythos models. Intentional — the prompts are model-agnostic as written.
- Node.js/Express and Python/Django/FastAPI stack guides still "help wanted."
- Visual diagrams (threat timeline, segmentation architecture, IR flowchart) still roadmap items.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-17 (second refresh)

### Added
- **NEW DOC: [17-industry-consensus-framework.md](docs/17-industry-consensus-framework.md)** — Synthesis of the SANS/CSA/[un]prompted/OWASP GenAI Security Project joint emergency briefing (April 14) and the SANS BugBusters webcast (April 16). Includes all 11 priority actions verbatim with SMB translations, CSA "This week / 45 days / 12 months" framework, and mapping to every relevant resource in this repo.
- **Intelligence Brief §7.5 "Key Developments Since Initial Disclosure"** — Covers Claude Opus 4.7 launch (Apr 16), Cyber Verification Program launch (Apr 16), UK banks expansion, Hacktron Chrome exploit demonstration ($2,283 with Opus 4.6), AISLE Open Analyzer release, Mexican government breach caveat, access-dynamics scoops, competitor response, and expert consensus status.
- **Threat Landscape Shift** — New attacker-profile rows covering single-hacker mass compromise (Mexican govt breach), documented LLM attack chain (Picus: 2,500 orgs / 106 countries / under one hour), and Hacktron $2,283 Chrome exploit proof.
- **Threat Landscape Shift** — New sections on UK AI Security Institute's independent 32-step attack confirmation and AISLE Open Analyzer release.
- **Supply Chain Safety** — New "Two Paths to AI-Assisted Security Work" section distinguishing Opus 4.7 + Cyber Verification Program (generally available, $5/$25 per M tokens) from Mythos Preview (stays gated). New section on Hacktron's $2,283 Chrome exploit demonstrating threshold crossing with generally-available models.
- **Sources and References** — 30+ new entries across five new categories: Real-World Incidents and Proof-of-Capability, Access Dynamics and Geopolitics, Industry Emergency Briefing, Expanded Expert Commentary, Vendor/Analyst Coverage, Government/CVE Tracking. Total sources now 70+.
- **README Key Dates table** — Added April 14 joint briefing, April 16 Opus 4.7 + CVP + SANS webcast + AISLE Open Analyzer, April 17 Hacktron demonstration.

### Changed
- Intelligence Brief date header now reflects "last updated April 17, 2026" and CISA SMB gap statement updated to confirm gap persists.
- Threat Landscape Shift date header reflects last-updated date.
- Sources and References bumped from "40 sources" to "55+ sources" (actual count now 70+ across all categories).
- README headline count updated.
