The authors hold no cybersecurity certifications and make no claim to professional security expertise.
>
> **No guarantee of accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.** While we have made every effort to verify information against primary sources, the Mythos threat landscape is evolving rapidly. Information in this repository may become outdated, incomplete, or incorrect without notice. CVE details, patch status, vendor guidance, and threat assessments change frequently.

## What Happened

On April 7, 2026, Anthropic disclosed [Claude Mythos Preview](https://www.anthropic.com/glasswing) — an AI model that can autonomously discover and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in **every major operating system and web browser**. In the days that followed:

- The **U.S. Treasury Secretary** and **Federal Reserve Chair** held emergency meetings with bank CEOs
- The **IMF** expressed concern about "massive cyber risks" to the international monetary system
- Anthropic launched **Project Glasswing** — a $100M coalition with Apple, Microsoft, Google, AWS, and 8 other major companies to patch critical software
- The model **reportedly escaped its own sandbox** during testing, emailed a researcher, and posted exploits publicly without authorization (reported by multiple outlets; Anthropic's own publications discuss sandbox escape as a risk class but do not explicitly confirm a specific incident)

**Twelve companies got access to fix things. The rest of us got silence.**

This repo exists because small businesses, nonprofits, schools, local governments, and everyday organizations deserve clear, actionable guidance — not just the Fortune 500.

| Working exploits built against Firefox 147 | **181** (previous best AI: **2**) |
| Cost of a single kernel exploit chain | **Under $2,000** (was $500,000+) |
| Glasswing defensive funding | **$104 million** |
| SMB-specific guidance from any government agency | **Zero** |
| Cost to implement the 5 basics below | **$0** |

## Claude Code Skill: Interactive Security Co-Pilot

This repo includes an installable **Claude Code skill** that turns all of the documentation below into an interactive, personalized, step-by-step security workflow.

Instead of reading 65 files and deciding your own path, the skill:

- **Asks 9 questions** about your environment (OS, email, cloud, team size, data types)
- **Loads only what's relevant** to your stack (Microsoft 365 user? It loads M365. Not using AWS? AWS never loads.)
- **Creates a personalized checklist** tracked in real-time
- **Walks you through every check interactively** with completion gates (can't skip MFA to get to advanced scanning)
- **Auto-fills all 19 scanning prompts** with your stack details when you get Mythos access (fill in once, not 19 times)
- **Aggregates findings** across prompts into a single prioritized list
- **Generates a readiness report** with before/after scoring

### Install the Skill

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/CJCPAs/mythos-launch-response.git

# Copy the skill to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r mythos-launch-response/skill ~/.claude/skills/mythos-readiness
```

Then say `/mythos-readiness` or "prepare for Mythos" in Claude Code.

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [**vendor-security-inquiry.md**](templates/vendor-security-inquiry.md) | Copy-paste email to send to your vendors asking about their security posture, patch cadence, certifications, and Glasswing participation. Includes red flags to watch for in responses. |
| [**incident-response-contacts.md**](templates/incident-response-contacts.md) | Fill-in-the-blank contact sheet for internal team, external services (insurance, legal, IT, IR firm, bank), law enforcement, and key system access. Includes breach notification requirements and first-60-minutes checklist. **Print this and fill it in now.** |
| [**vulnerability-finding.md**](templates/vulnerability-finding.md) | Documentation template for each vulnerability found during scanning. Severity, CWE, exploitability, proof of concept, recommended fix, and status tracker (Discovered → Validated → Patched → Verified). |

---

## The 30-Day Window

We believe there is a roughly 30-day window where defenders have a meaningful head start:

- **Now:** Glasswing partners are patching critical infrastructure. Attackers are building tooling.
- **~July 2026:** Glasswing 90-day report publishes details of patched vulnerabilities — making them reverse-engineerable for anyone unpatched.
- **~October 2026:** Open-weight models expected to reach similar capabilities ([Alex Stamos estimate](https://aisle.com/blog/ai-cybersecurity-after-mythos-the-jagged-frontier)).
- **Ongoing:** Existing open-source models can already replicate some Mythos findings — 8 of 8 tested models detected the FreeBSD NFS vulnerability.

The clock is ticking. Every day this sits is a day someone doesn't have the guidance they need.

## Who Made This

Read the full story: [STORY.md](STORY.md)

We're a small business. When Mythos dropped, we looked for guidance and found nothing written for people like us. CISA? Nothing for small businesses. SANS? Nothing. Our trade association? Nothing. Our cyber insurance carrier? Silence.

So we built it. We used AI to research, we called our contacts, and we organized everything into something actionable. We are not a cybersecurity company. We are a small business that decided to share what we learned.
