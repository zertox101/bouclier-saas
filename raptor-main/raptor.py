RAPTOR - Unified Security Testing Launcher

Single entry point for all RAPTOR capabilities:
- Static analysis (Semgrep + CodeQL)
- Binary fuzzing (AFL++)
- Web application scanning
- Autonomous LLM-powered analysis
- And more...

Usage:
    raptor.py <mode> [options]

Available Modes:
    scan        - Static code analysis (Semgrep + CodeQL)
    fuzz        - Binary fuzzing with AFL++
    web         - Web application security testing
    agentic     - Full autonomous workflow
    codeql      - CodeQL-only analysis
    doctor      - Status report for local setup (no claude needed)
    help        - Show detailed help for a specific mode

Examples:
    # Full autonomous workflow
    python3 raptor.py agentic --repo /path/to/code

    # Static analysis only
    python3 raptor.py scan --repo /path/to/code --policy-groups secrets,owasp

    # Binary fuzzing
    python3 raptor.py fuzz --binary /path/to/binary --duration 3600

    # Web scanning
    python3 raptor.py web --url https://example.com
