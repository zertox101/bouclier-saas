"""Phase D wiring: source_intel evidence into Stage D LLM prompts.

The orchestrator pre-seeds a target's source_intel result once per
run (one spatch invocation per target). The dispatch tasks pull
per-finding evidence from the cache and pass it into the prompt
bundle as additional :class:`UntrustedBlock` entries.

This is the second consumer wiring for source_intel — the first
(``packages.codeql.dataflow_validator``) plugs into the
``evidence_collector=`` channel for individual CodeQL findings.
This module plugs into the broader ``llm_analysis`` family used by
``/agentic`` and ``/analyze`` for any finding (CodeQL or otherwise)
whose rule_id matches the memory-corruption set.

  * Source_intel is a SIDECAR — evidence, never verdict.
  * Evidence renders as ``UntrustedBlock(kind="source-intel-evidence")``
    so the prompt-envelope discipline applies uniformly.
  * Only memory-corruption-class findings receive evidence — others
    would carry irrelevant prose that wastes LLM budget.

API:
  * :func:`prepare_source_intel(repo_path)` — pre-seed the cache.
    Called from the orchestrator after dispatch starts but before
    findings are processed. Best-effort: failures (spatch missing,
    target unreadable) are logged and skipped — the dispatch
    proceeds with no source_intel evidence rather than failing.
  * :func:`evidence_blocks_for_finding(finding)` — return a tuple
    of ``UntrustedBlock`` entries to inject into the prompt's
    ``extra_blocks``. Returns ``()`` when no relevant evidence
    exists for this finding.

Caching: process-global dict keyed by absolute resolved repo path.
Mirrors the inventory cache pattern in
``packages.source_intel.analyze``. One entry per target — multiple
findings in one repo share the spatch result.
