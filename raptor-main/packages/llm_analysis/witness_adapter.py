"""Adapter: LLM-emitted exploit → ``core.witness.Witness``.

``/agentic`` synthesises an exploit per finding (via
``AutonomousSecurityAgentV2``), compile-verifies it, and runs the
intent-match judge over the result — but never *executes* the
exploit. The exploit-source bytes are still a witness of intent:
recording them under the canonical Witness type makes them
available alongside fuzz-generated witnesses for downstream
consumers (reporting, future ZKPoX bundle assembly, future
calibrated IntentMatchJudge) on the same data path.

The witness records:

  * ``source = LLM_EMIT_RUN``
  * ``observed_outcome = NOT_RUN`` — by design, ``/agentic``
    doesn't execute exploits. Future Tier-1.5 native execution
    will produce ``EXIT_SIGNAL`` / ``SANITIZER_REPORT`` /
    ``FLAG_CAPTURED`` witnesses for the same finding; the
    bytes_hash matches across both, so the witness store
    dedups the LLM artefact when the executed run lands.
  * ``outcome_detail`` carries the compile verdict + intent-match
    verdict so reporting can filter without re-reading the
    exploit text.

Adapter lives in ``packages/llm_analysis/`` rather than
``core/witness/`` so the dependency arrow points the right way
(packages depend on core, not vice versa).

    """Wrap an LLM-emitted exploit as a ``Witness`` + the raw bytes.

    Returns ``(witness, bytes_)``. Callers typically pass both
    straight to ``WitnessStore.put(witness, bytes_)``.

    ``exploit_code`` is UTF-8 encoded once with ``errors="replace"``
    so unpaired surrogates from a poorly-decoded LLM response don't
    raise ``UnicodeEncodeError`` — the replacement byte sequence is
    what gets hashed and stored. The replacement is conservative
    (U+FFFD per invalid codepoint) so semantically-meaningful
    exploit text survives intact; only the genuinely-broken bytes
    are normalised. The resulting bytes are the canonical witness.

    ``compiled`` carries the verify verdict; ``None`` is the right
    encoding for "verification not attempted" (e.g.
    ``--no-verify-exploits``).

    ``intent_verdict`` is one of ``"matches"``/``"off_target"``/
    ``"uncertain"`` (the strings, not the enum — keeping the
    witness store free of llm_analysis-specific imports). ``None``
    means the judge wasn't run.

    ``target_source_path`` is optional; when provided and the file
    exists, it's hashed and stored so a later run can verify it's
    still the same source before claiming the witness holds.

    ``target_binary_path`` is the analogous slot for binaries — used
    when the LLM-emitted exploit was synthesised against a built
    target (e.g. crash-agent's path from a fuzz crash). The
    ``/agentic`` path normally has source only, no binary.

    ``executed_outcome`` overrides the default ``NOT_RUN`` when the
    caller actually ran the exploit (the PR E path:
    ``--execute-exploits`` is on, ``compile_and_execute`` returned an
    outcome). ``executed_detail`` (when present) merges into
    ``outcome_detail`` so the executed signal / sanitizer / blocked
    fields land alongside the compile + intent-match verdicts.
    Default ``None`` keeps the legacy NOT_RUN behaviour.
