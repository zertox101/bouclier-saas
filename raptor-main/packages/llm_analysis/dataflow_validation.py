"""IRIS-style dataflow validation for /agentic findings.

Pattern (from IRIS, ICLR 2025): Semgrep flags a finding; the LLM analysis
step claims a dataflow path ("input flows from source to sink"); we
validate the claim by generating a CodeQL query and running it against
a pre-built database. Confirmed → finding stands; refuted → downgrade
exploitability with the audit trail intact; inconclusive → no change.

Why this works (from IRIS results): Semgrep is good at syntactic patterns
but doesn't track inter-procedural dataflow. The LLM is good at imagining
a dataflow path but not at verifying one exists. CodeQL is good at
verifying dataflow but needs the right source/sink spec. Putting them in
the right roles — Semgrep finds candidates, LLM proposes a CodeQL query,
CodeQL adjudicates — is the IRIS recipe.

This helper is opt-in via /agentic --validate-dataflow. It requires a
pre-built CodeQL database (typically produced by the same /agentic run's
--codeql phase). When the database is unavailable or the budget is
exhausted, the helper is a no-op.

        summary is the LLM's claim; without it there's nothing to test.
      - Finding must NOT already have CodeQL dataflow evidence. The
        ``has_dataflow`` flag is set when CodeQL produced a path for
        this finding; if it's set, the claim is already grounded and
        re-running an IRIS query against the same DB is waste. This
        check is the natural skip for ``@kind path-problem`` CodeQL
        findings (which carry dataflow); ``@kind problem`` CodeQL
        findings (purely syntactic, no SARIF dataflow) DO go through
        IRIS validation when the LLM's analysis produced a dataflow
        claim, because the LLM's claim is independent of the SARIF.
      - Analysis must not be in error state. Validating a failed

    dataflow claim against CodeQL"; what scanner produced the original

    gated on ``tool == "semgrep"`` to skip CodeQL findings, but the

_VALIDATION_TASK_GUIDANCE = """\
TASK: You are validating a security finding's dataflow claim against a
pre-built CodeQL database. The upstream scanner pattern-matched on a
single location; the LLM analysis claimed an inter-procedural dataflow
path exists from a source to that location.

Your job is to write a CodeQL query that tests whether that path is
actually reachable in the codebase, not to find all possible
vulnerabilities. Focus the query narrowly on the specific claim.

Recommended shape:
  - For taint claims (input → sink): a TaintTracking::Configuration with
    isSource matching the claimed source kind and isSink matching the
    claimed sink location.
  - For reachability claims (function A reaches function B): a
    PathProblem query over the call graph.

CRITICAL — current CodeQL dataflow API (use exactly this pattern; the
old `class C extends TaintTracking::Configuration` API is REMOVED in
current packs and will NOT compile):

  /**
   * @kind path-problem
   * @id raptor/<descriptive-id>
   */
  import python
  import semmle.python.dataflow.new.DataFlow
  import semmle.python.dataflow.new.TaintTracking
  import semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources

  module MyConfig implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {
    predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node n) {
      // e.g. n instanceof RemoteFlowSource
    }
    predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node n) {
      // e.g. exists(Call c | c.getFunc().(...) ... and n.asExpr() = c.getArg(0))
    }
  }

  module MyFlow = TaintTracking::Global<MyConfig>;
  import MyFlow::PathGraph

  from MyFlow::PathNode source, MyFlow::PathNode sink
  where MyFlow::flowPath(source, sink)
  select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "<message>"

Key differences from the old API:
  - Define a `module` implementing `DataFlow::ConfigSig`, NOT a class
    extending `TaintTracking::Configuration`.
  - Predicates are NOT `override` (modules don't have inheritance).
  - Wrap the config with `TaintTracking::Global<MyConfig>` to create a
    flow module; PathGraph and PathNode come from THAT module
    (e.g. `MyFlow::PathGraph`, `MyFlow::PathNode`), NOT a standalone
    `DataFlow::PathGraph` import.
  - Final `where` clause uses `MyFlow::flowPath(source, sink)`.

Module-path imports per language:

  PYTHON:    import semmle.python.dataflow.new.{DataFlow, TaintTracking, RemoteFlowSources}
  JAVA:      import semmle.code.java.dataflow.{DataFlow, TaintTracking, FlowSources}
  JS/TS:     import javascript    (DataFlow / TaintTracking are top-level)

             import semmle.code.cpp.security.FlowSources
  GO:        import semmle.go.dataflow.{DataFlow, TaintTracking}

If the dataflow_summary describes a path that isn't expressible as a
TaintTracking or PathProblem query (e.g. "this function trusts the
caller to validate input"), pick the closest mechanical test and note
the limitation in your reasoning."""

      "refuted"      — query lives under EXTRA_CODEQL_PACK_ROOTS

                       The flow is genuinely absent — caller should
                       skip downstream LLM cost.

                       confirmed/refuted (matches elsewhere; or
                       stdlib query with broad model returned 0

                       was provided for the language, or codeql/the

                       this as "haven't checked" and proceed.

    Cache reuse: the underlying `codeql database analyze` call
    is cached by CodeQL (BQRS files keyed on query+DB), so calling
    `tier1_check_finding` multiple times for the same (DB, query)
    pair — including the orchestrator's later `validate_dataflow_claims`
    pass — is essentially free after the first invocation.

    """Derive verdict from a prebuilt-query result.

    Asymmetry depends on which pack the query came from. Stdlib queries
    use `RemoteFlowSource` only (network inputs); they cannot refute a
    finding alone because the LLM's claim might involve a CLI / env /
    stdin source that the model doesn't cover. In-repo extras packs
    (`RaptorConfig.EXTRA_CODEQL_PACK_ROOTS`) ship `LocalFlowSource`
    queries selecting remote + commandargs + environment + stdin + file
    threat models — broad enough that a no-match result IS meaningful
    refutation.

    Verdict logic:
      - tool failed → inconclusive
      - matches at finding location → confirmed
      - matches elsewhere → inconclusive
      - no matches, query from stdlib pack → inconclusive
        (caller falls through to Tier 2 for LLM-customised refutation)
      - no matches, query from in-repo extras pack:
        - and `codeql_db` provided AND finding's file is in DB index
            → refuted
        - else → inconclusive (DB coverage couldn't be verified, so
            "no matches" might just mean "file wasn't extracted" —
            silent false negatives that direction are worse than a
            slightly weaker Tier 1 signal)

    The DB-coverage gate matters because real-world CodeQL DBs miss
    files for ordinary reasons: build failures skipping a class,
    paths-ignore in the operator's codeql-config.yml, the DB being
    from a different commit than the finding's source. Without the
    gate, "DB doesn't index this file" silently looks identical to
    "the flow truly doesn't exist", and refutation downgrades a real
    finding. Empirical motivation: the bug was caught in PR-G's
    adversarial review (Q1).

    `codeql_db` is required for refutation. Calling without it (or
    passing None) when the query is in an extras pack is treated as
    "coverage cannot be verified" — the function logs a WARNING and
    returns inconclusive rather than silently refuting. This closes
    the false-negative backdoor where an unset `_database_path`
    (e.g. via a defensive getattr fallback) would silently bypass
    the coverage gate.
