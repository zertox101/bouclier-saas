RAPTOR Orchestrator — Phase 4 of the /agentic workflow.

Dispatches structured findings from Phase 3 for parallel vulnerability
analysis, exploit generation, patch creation, consensus, and retry.

Dispatch routing:
  - External LLM configured: parallel generate_structured() / generate()
  - No external LLM + claude on PATH: claude -p sub-agents (via cc_dispatch)
  - Neither: return None (manual review)

If external LLM fails entirely, falls back to CC dispatch automatically.

    Two concerns:

    * ``repo_path`` is an absolute filesystem path on the operator's
      machine (``/home/alice/projects/my-target``,
      ``/tmp/raptor/foo``); stamping it onto each finding earlier in
      the pipeline (line ~303) is necessary for SAGE enrichment
      scoping, but leaking it into the persisted report exposes
      operator filesystem layout downstream (username, project
      naming, runner tmp-dir hierarchy). Strip AFTER all internal
      consumers have used it (judge, consensus, aggregation) and
      BEFORE save_json hits disk.
    * ``status`` is the QoL #19 canonical enum
      (``analysed`` / ``analysis_inconsistent`` / ``error`` /
      ``skipped_*``). Stamping it here lets on-disk readers
      (raptor_agentic summary, report renderers, future automation)
      consume positive status markers instead of detecting via
      null-fields. Derived from the per-finding shape via
      ``core.run.finding_status.derive_status`` — no fields
      invented; consumers that previously inferred from
      ``is_true_positive is None`` / ``self_contradictory`` /
      ``error`` keys now read ``status`` instead.

    Skipped variants (``skipped_over_budget``,
    ``skipped_duplicate``, etc.) are stamped by their respective
    producers (budget cap, dedup, binary-oracle) at skip time —
    this finaliser only handles the analysed / inconsistent /
    error cases that survive to the orchestrator emit.

    Extracted from the inline emit-time loop so it's unit-testable
    without driving the full orchestrate() dispatch path.

    Producer-stamped status (when a specific skip-reason or
    error-class producer set ``status`` explicitly upstream) is
    PRESERVED — derive's generic fallback would lose the
    specificity (``skipped_over_budget`` would become generic
    ``skipped``). Only stamp when status is absent or carries an
