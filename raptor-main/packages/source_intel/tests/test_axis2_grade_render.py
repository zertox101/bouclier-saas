"""Tests for axis-2 abort-grade caveats in render output.

Phase C PR1: each grade carries the correct strength prose:
  * dominates    — strong, no caveat needed
  * same_path    — mid-strength, explicit "other branches bypass" caveat
  * same_function — weak, explicit "may be unrelated path" caveat
