"""Source intelligence analyzer — orchestrates cocci rules + alias
scanning to produce structured evidence per target.

Phase 2 (substrate) ships exactly one axis: ``axis 1 / attrs`` covering
``warn_unused_result``. Axes 2-7 plug in by adding rule directories
under ``engine/coccinelle/source_intel/`` and aggregators here.

The output is a :class:`SourceIntelResult` (frozen) keyed on target +
rule-set hash. The Stage D LLM consumer consumes it via
:mod:`packages.source_intel.render`; the corpus runner consumes it
via :mod:`packages.source_intel.adapter`.

Hard invariants (carried from design):
  * Strict sidecar — produces evidence, never overrides verdict.
  * ``--no-includes`` to spatch by default (untrusted-target posture
    matching PR-3 cocci scan + PR-4 prereqs).
  * Out-of-tree symbols never fabricated — `function_attrs_status`
    explicit when a symbol isn't found.

# nested analyze() calls on subdirectories.
#
# Why module-global: ``_enclosing_function`` is called from 15+
# sites across analyze.py + adapter.py without a context-carrying
# parameter. Threading inventory through every call site would
# touch ~30 lines per consumer and break test mocks that don't
# care about the inventory. The cache lets analyze() seed the
# tree-sitter path while leaving the function signature and
# behaviour identical for downstream code.
#
# Each value is a ``(signature, inventory)`` tuple where signature
# is produced by :func:`packages.source_intel.cache.compute_target_signature`.
# Lookups recompute the signature and silently drop entries that
# don't match — auto-invalidation across consecutive runs in the
# same process. Two ``/agentic`` runs on the same path see a stale
# inventory only if the source hasn't changed (correct), and see a
# fresh build whenever any file's mtime/size or build-marker shifts.
#
# Thread-safety: the dict is guarded by ``_INVENTORY_LOCK`` (an
# ``RLock`` so a callback firing inside a lookup that triggers
# another lookup doesn't self-deadlock). The CPython GIL would in
# practice make dict reads + writes atomic at the bytecode level,
# but the multi-step lookup (find best_target → recompute signature
# → pop-or-return) reads the dict twice and would race with a
# concurrent register or another lookup's pop. The lock is taken
# only around the dict ops themselves, not while computing the
# signature (which walks the filesystem and could take ms).

    Algorithm of the regex fallback (Phase B PR3 + post-E2E fixes):
      1. Walk backward from ``line``. Skip preprocessor lines,

         matches the full ``_FUNC_DEF_RE`` (``name(args)[{``) and the

         ``static CURLcode do_sendmsg(\\n    struct Curl_cfilter *cf,\\n    ...)``
         are matched once paren balance is reached on a later line.

    NOT a full C parser — still misses (in fallback mode only):
    K&R-style decls, function-pointer typedefs that look like calls,
    split type+name across lines. Good enough for the kernel and
    curl-style ANSI C; ambiguous cases return ``None`` which the
