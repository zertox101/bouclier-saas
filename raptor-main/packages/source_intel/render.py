"""Render :class:`SourceIntelResult` evidence into prompt-friendly
strings for Stage D / `/exploit` / `/agentic` consumers.

The output is a list of human-readable lines; ordering puts the
strongest signal first (literal observations before alias-only).
Consumers concatenate the lines into a structured block under
TaintedString / UntrustedBlock envelopes per the project's prompt-
envelope discipline.

Three styles surfaced in Phase 2:
  * ``stage_d`` — evidence supporting/against a Stage D ruling
  * ``exploit_plan`` — constraints to plan around for /exploit
  * ``agentic_variant`` — seed candidates for variant hunting

For substrate, all three render the same content with style-specific
phrasing. Axes 2-7 may diverge per style when their evidence
classes have distinct interpretations per consumer.

Also provides ``derive_mitigations_found()`` — structured list of
``Mitigation`` records per design strict invariant ("mitigations_found:
[...] shape; no boolean hardened. Absence ≠ unhardened.").

    Three prose tiers based on (cap_function, cap_constant, grade):

      1. Strongest ("ROOT-EQUIVALENT, finding is privilege-gated"):
         cap_function gates against GLOBAL credentials
         (``_GLOBAL_CRED_CAP_FUNCTIONS``: ``capable``) AND constant
         is root-equivalent (``_PRIVILEGED_CAP_CONSTANTS_FOR_RENDER``).
         Bug not reachable from unprivileged context.

      2. Userns-caveat ("namespace-scoped, root-equivalent CAP can
         be held by userns admin"): cap_function is namespace-scoped
         (``_NS_SCOPED_CAP_FUNCTIONS``: ``ns_capable`` and
         relatives) BUT constant is root-equivalent. An unprivileged
         user can ``unshare -U`` into a userns and hold the CAP
         there — bug IS reachable, just one userns hop away. LLM
         must NOT treat as privilege-gated.

      3. Generic ("Attacker must hold checked capability"): cap
         constant not in root-equivalent set OR cap_function
         unknown. Soft-signal prose; LLM weighs.

    The (cap_function, grade) gate matters: on ``same_path``
    grade, the cap may be on a branch the sink isn't on, so even
    a root-equivalent constant doesn't gate. Only ``dominates``
    and ``same_function`` qualify for the strong/userns tiers.
