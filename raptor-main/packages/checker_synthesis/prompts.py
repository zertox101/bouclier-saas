"""Prompt templates for checker synthesis + match triage.

Two LLM tasks live here:

  * ``synthesis`` — given a confirmed bug, produce a checker rule.
  * ``triage``    — given a candidate match from running that rule,
                    classify it as variant / false_positive / uncertain.

Both produce structured JSON responses validated against schemas
defined in this module. The schemas double as in-prompt
documentation — the LLM sees them, so the output shape is explicit.
