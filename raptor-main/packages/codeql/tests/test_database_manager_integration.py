"""Integration tests for CodeQL database_manager concurrent-write safety.

These tests use real multiprocessing (one mp.Process per worker, spawn
context) to exercise the build-in-staging + atomic-promote flow with
real PIDs and real concurrent file operations — exactly the conditions
where the bug this fix addresses (two concurrent /codeql runs corrupting
each other's canonical DB) actually manifests.

Mocks-only unit tests in test_database_manager.py validate the logic
shape; these tests validate behaviour under real concurrency.

Tests are timing-sensitive (rely on sleep widening the race window).
Marked slow; default 30s timeout per test.
