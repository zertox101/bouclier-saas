"""Tests for language_detector's build-manifest-aware detection (gh #548).

Regression test for the silent-skip bug where ``min_files=3`` dropped
tiny-but-real modules (e.g. a Go API with 2 ``.go`` files + ``go.mod``).
The fix: a matching build manifest counts as evidence on its own,
provided per-language confidence still passes — ``min_confidence``
continues to protect against stray manifests alone.
