"""
SMT-based path condition feasibility checker for CodeQL dataflow findings.

The LLM extracts branch conditions from a dataflow path as structured
constraint strings; this module encodes them into Z3 bitvector expressions
and checks whether they are jointly satisfiable.

- sat   → path is reachable; model gives concrete variable values for PoC
- unsat → path conditions are mutually exclusive (likely false positive);
          unsat core names the specific conflicting conditions
- None  → Z3 unavailable or all conditions unparseable; fall back to LLM

Accepted condition forms (case-insensitive):
  size > 0
  size < 1024
  offset + length <= buffer_size
  count * 16 < max_alloc       (bitvector mul — wraps at the chosen width)
  n >> 1 < limit               (arithmetic right shift when the profile is
                               signed; logical right shift when unsigned)
  n << 3 == buf_size           (left shift)
  flags | 0x1 != 0             (bitwise OR)
  ptr != NULL  /  ptr == NULL
  index >= 0
  flags & 0x80000000 == 0
  value == 42

Width and signedness are carried by a ``BVProfile`` (from
``core.smt_solver``).  Default is ``BV_C_UINT64`` — 64-bit unsigned,
matching sizes / offsets / counts which dominate dataflow path
conditions.  Pass ``BV_C_UINT32`` to detect 32-bit unsigned wraparound
(CWE-190); pass ``BV_C_INT32`` for signed-integer path conditions.
Pre-made profiles are importable from ``core.smt_solver``.

Conditions rejected to the ``unknown`` bucket (rather than silently
mis-encoded):

  - **Operators outside the supported set.**  Accepted: ``+ - * |``,
    relational ``< <= > >= == !=``, shifts ``<< >>``, bitmask
    ``&`` (only in the ``flags & MASK == VAL`` form), and grouping
    parentheses ``( )``.  Rejected: unary NOT (``~``), XOR (``^``),
    division (``/``), modulo (``%``), ternary (``? :``), single-equals
    assignment, chained relational (``0 < x < 100``).  Anything else
    goes to ``unknown`` via the full-input-consumed sanity check.
  - **C-syntax constructs (other than function calls and grouping).**
    Type casts (``(uint32_t)x``), struct/pointer access (``obj.field``,
    ``s->len``), array indexing (``arr[0]``), pointer dereference
    (``*p``), ``sizeof``.  Any token containing ``.``, ``->``, ``[``,
    ``]`` still triggers rejection.  Function calls are an exception —
    see the free-variable fallback below.
  - **Negative integer literals** (e.g. ``!= -1``) — write the
    bit-pattern in hex instead (``!= 0xFFFFFFFF`` at uint32).
  - **Leading-zero decimals** (e.g. ``01234``) — ambiguous with C
    octal; use hex or remove the leading zero.
  - **Literals outside the profile's width range** — ``0x100`` at
    uint8 would silently wrap to 0 in z3; we reject so the caller
    knows the profile was wrong for this literal.
  - **Unbalanced parentheses** — extra ``(`` or ``)``, mismatched
    nesting (``)(``), or a paren count that doesn't return to zero.

Function-call subterms (``strlen(input)``, ``getpid()``, ...) are
recovered through a free-variable fallback: each balanced
``<ident>(...)`` subterm is replaced with an ``_anon_N`` Z3 variable
before parsing, so the rest of the condition can still contribute to
feasibility analysis.  Textually-identical calls *within one
``check_path_feasibility`` batch* (whether in the same condition string
or across conditions in the list) share a single placeholder — the
LLM's textual repetition of ``strlen(input)`` is read as intent that
both references denote the same value, matching how a human writer
would mean it.  Across separate ``check_path_feasibility`` calls the
state resets; two batches that both mention ``strlen(input)`` allocate
independent vars, preserving the conservative impure-call default for
batch boundaries where the LLM has no way to express same-value intent.

This dedup contract assumes the conditions reflect an SSA view of the
path: every appearance of an identifier denotes the same value.  A
real CFG that mutates an identifier between guards
(``input = realloc(input, n)``) violates that assumption.  Two
defences:

  1. *Preferred — caller SSA-renames across mutations.*  Emit
     ``strlen(input_pre) > 100`` then ``strlen(input_post) < 50``
     instead of the same ``strlen(input)`` text twice.  Distinct text
     → distinct placeholders → solver models the mutation correctly.
     The LLM prompts in ``packages/codeql/dataflow_validator.py``
     and ``packages/llm_analysis/prompts/schemas.py`` instruct the
     extractor to do this.

  2. *Defence-in-depth — assignment-shape barrier.*  Conditions that
     contain a top-level assignment (``=``), compound-assignment
     (``+=`` / ``-=`` / ...), or increment/decrement (``++`` / ``--``)
     token are routed to :data:`RejectionKind.ASSIGNMENT_SHAPED`.
     :func:`check_path_feasibility` then resets the call-dedup window
     at that step so identical-text calls *after* the mutation
     allocate fresh placeholders.  This catches the common case where
     the LLM emits the program statement verbatim
     (``input = realloc(input, n)``) without SSA-renaming the
     surrounding guards — the verdict goes to "feasible (post-mutation
     calls allocated fresh)" rather than a false refutation.

Other limitations (verdict still trustworthy, but with caveats):

  - **C operator precedence**, not arithmetic-textbook precedence.
    Within an expression, ``*`` binds tightest, then ``+ -``, then
    ``<< >>``, then ``|`` (lowest).  All left-associative.  The
    notable surprise is that shifts bind *less* tightly than additive
    operators in C — ``a + b << 2`` parses as ``(a + b) << 2``, not
    ``a + (b << 2)``.  Use parentheses to make the grouping explicit
    when the C reading isn't what was meant.
  - **Bitmask form** requires both ``MASK`` and ``VAL`` to be integer
    literals; variables on either side go to ``unknown``.
  - **Profile-level signedness conflates** two concerns: comparison
    signedness (``<``/``<=``/``>``/``>=`` routed through ``lt``/``le``)
    AND ``>>`` arithmetic-vs-logical shift.  In real C these can
    decouple (``(int)x >> 1`` is always arithmetic regardless of the
    comparison's signedness).  Single-profile-per-path is the
    first-cut design; per-variable typing is the next step when a
    real case demands it.
  - **Z3 picks the smallest satisfying witness by default**, which is
    often the trivial assignment (``x = 0``).  To drive the witness
    into the dangerous range, pass ``prefer_witness=("count", "max")``
    (or the shim's ``--prefer-witness max:count``) and the encoder
    swaps in a ``z3.Optimize`` backend with the corresponding
    ``maximize`` objective.  Manual lower-bound hints (e.g.
    ``count > 0x10000000``) still work and remain useful when the
    caller wants to constrain the search to a specific subrange
    rather than push to the extreme.

    """Replace balanced ``<ident>(...)`` subterms with free Z3 variables.

    Each function-call-shaped subterm is swapped for an ``_anon_N``
    placeholder registered as a free Z3 bitvector in ``vars_``.  Lets
    conditions like ``strlen(input) < 1024`` parse instead of being
    rejected wholesale on the parens check.

    Nested calls collapse to a single placeholder
    (``f(g(x))`` → ``_anon_0``), since the outer call drives the
    balanced-paren walk.

    **Dedup contract.** Textually-identical call substrings share one
    placeholder within a single ``_substitute_calls`` invocation, and —
    when ``anon_map`` is supplied — across all invocations that share
    that map (the call ``_anon_N → call-text`` mapping doubles as a
    dedup oracle).  Pre-fix every match allocated a fresh placeholder,
    so ``strlen(input) > 100 AND strlen(input) < 50`` across two
    conditions in one ``check_path_feasibility`` batch encoded as
    ``_anon_0 > 100 AND _anon_1 < 50`` — trivially satisfiable when
    the two ``strlen(input)`` texts were meant to denote one value.
    Reusing the placeholder when the call text exactly matches an
    earlier subterm makes the encoding model writer intent: the LLM
    re-typing ``strlen(input)`` reads as "same expression, same
    value".  The conservative impure-call default is preserved at
    *batch boundaries* — different ``check_path_feasibility`` calls
    allocate fresh state — because that's the only granularity at
    which the LLM has no syntactic way to spell shared identity.

    Dedup is by literal text equality, so whitespace differences
    (``strlen(s)`` vs ``strlen( s )``) and argument-form differences
    (``strlen(a)`` vs ``strlen(b)``) stay distinct.

    **SSA assumption.** Dedup assumes the conditions reflect an SSA
    view of the path: every appearance of an identifier denotes the
    same value.  A real CFG that mutates an identifier between
    guards (``input = realloc(input, n)``) violates this — two
    ``strlen(input)`` references straddling that mutation refer to
    different memory.  The caller must SSA-rename across mutations
    (``strlen(input_pre)`` / ``strlen(input_post)``) so dedup matches
    intent, OR rely on :func:`check_path_feasibility` to detect
    assignment-shaped conditions (via
    :data:`RejectionKind.ASSIGNMENT_SHAPED`) and break the
    ``dedup_window`` at each mutation step — see
    :func:`check_path_feasibility` for that defence-in-depth layer.

    Unbalanced parens (``strlen(x``) are left in place; the caller's
    parens-check still rejects them.

    When ``anon_map`` is supplied, each new ``_anon_N`` allocated
    here is recorded with the original substring it replaced
    (``anon_map["_anon_0"] = "strlen(argv[1])"``).  Threaded through
    ``_parse_condition`` and ``_classify_text_condition`` from
    ``check_path_feasibility`` so the final ``PathSMTResult`` can
    surface meaningful labels for the witness model.  ``anon_map``
    accumulates ALL placeholder→call-text bindings allocated across
    every invocation that shares it — including across mutation
    barriers — because labels are global per-result.

    ``dedup_window`` is the optional source-of-truth for *which*
    placeholders the current invocation may reuse.  Distinct from
    ``anon_map`` so the caller can scope dedup to a window narrower
    than the full label store: pass a fresh dict per call to disable
    cross-call dedup, pass a shared dict spanning every call in a
    batch to enable it, ``.clear()`` between calls at a mutation
    barrier to reset the window.  When ``dedup_window`` is omitted
    and ``anon_map`` is supplied, dedup falls back to inverting
    ``anon_map`` (the pre-D2 behaviour, preserving backward
    compatibility for callers that don't manage their own window).
    When both are omitted, dedup is intra-invocation only.
