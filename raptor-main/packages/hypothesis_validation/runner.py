"""HypothesisRunner — drive the LLM-tool-LLM validation loop.

Single-shot flow (Phase A — no iteration):

    1. Filter adapters to those available on the host.
    2. Build a system prompt that lists tool capabilities.
    3. Ask the LLM to pick a tool and generate a rule for the hypothesis.
    4. Run the chosen adapter with the generated rule.
    5. Ask the LLM to evaluate the tool's evidence and produce a verdict.
    6. Return ValidationResult with the full audit trail.

The runner does not "trust" the LLM's verdict naively: refutation requires
that the tool ran successfully (success=True) and produced no matches.
Inconclusive is the verdict when the tool errored or no applicable tool
exists — the LLM cannot override absence of mechanical evidence with an
opinion. Confirmation requires that the tool produced concrete matches.

Future iteration loop (Phase B, deferred): if the LLM marks the result
inconclusive AND a refined rule is suggested, re-run the adapter with the
refined rule, up to N iterations. Currently `iterations` is fixed at 1.

You are a security analyst validating a vulnerability hypothesis using

Your job is NOT to declare the code vulnerable yourself. Your job is to:

  3. After the tool runs, evaluate whether its output confirms or refutes
     the hypothesis based on the concrete matches.

Rules:
  - You must pick exactly one tool from the available list.
  - The rule you generate must be valid syntax for the chosen tool.

     limitation in your reasoning.

Evaluate whether the tool evidence supports the hypothesis. Verdict guidance:

  confirmed   — Matches are present AND consistent with the hypothesis claim.
                Spurious or unrelated matches do NOT confirm — they refute or
                are inconclusive.
  refuted     — Tool ran successfully and produced no matches. Note that this
                only refutes the specific rule; weaker tools may have missed
                evidence the hypothesis predicts.
  inconclusive — Tool errored, was the wrong tool for the hypothesis, or
                produced ambiguous results.

Be concise in your reasoning — one or two sentences explaining the verdict
based on the concrete evidence above.
