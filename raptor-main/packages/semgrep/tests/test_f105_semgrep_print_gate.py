"""Regression test for F105.

`raptor_agentic.py` prints "✓ Scanned with Semgrep" in the final
summary block, gated only on:

    if not args.codeql_only:
        print("   ✓ Scanned with Semgrep")

That fires regardless of whether Semgrep actually ran successfully:
the operator sees the green check even when the scan timed out,
returned a non-{0,1} exit code, or produced no metrics file
(`scan_metrics.json` absent). The print is asymmetric vs. the very
next block which correctly gates on the metrics dict:

    if codeql_metrics:
        print("   ✓ Scanned with CodeQL")

Fix: tighten the gate to ALSO check the metrics dict (a non-empty
`semgrep_metrics` only exists on rc in {0, 1} + metrics file
present + not-timed-out). Matches the CodeQL pattern at line 1444.

This test parses `raptor_agentic.py` with ``ast`` (avoiding the
heavyweight import path) and asserts the gate condition around the
"Scanned with Semgrep" print includes a reference to
`semgrep_metrics`.
