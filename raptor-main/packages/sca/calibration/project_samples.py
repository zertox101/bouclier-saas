"""Project-sample collection for the calibration corpus.

For each project in :data:`PROJECT_SAMPLES`, the collector:

  1. Shallow-clones the project to a transient temp dir.
  2. Runs ``run_sca`` against it (offline-OSV, cache-friendly).
  3. Writes the findings to
     ``packages/sca/data/calibration/project_samples/<ecosystem>/
     <name>.json``.
  4. **Discards the source.** We never store the cloned tree —
     only OUR scan output, which is RAPTOR-generated and ships
     under MIT.

The output schema strips file paths under the project root; only
the dep + finding metadata that the corpus needs for validation
(``raptor_risk_estimate``, ``severity``, ``in_kev``, ``epss``,
``cve_id``) is preserved. Project source code is NEVER included.

License compliance:

  * We don't redistribute the cloned project — it's transient.
  * Our scan output is RAPTOR-generated (MIT). Each output JSON
    carries a ``_source.license: "MIT (RAPTOR-generated)"`` block.
  * The license-compliance check (:mod:`._license_check`) treats
    files under ``project_samples/`` permissively (filename refs
    not required in ATTRIBUTION.md per-file; the parent dir's
    citation suffices).

The project list is intentionally small for the bootstrap — top-N
per ecosystem can come later via the ``popular/<eco>.json``
auto-derived list. Curated start lets us control which licenses
we touch (only OSI-approved permissive). Each entry pins the
clone target so re-runs are reproducible.

    # ---- Round-9 CPM + Gradle catalog parser-coverage (2026-05-22) ---
    # Earlier NuGet expansion was capped by the "CPM trap" — most
    # modern .NET projects centralise versions in
    # ``Directory.Packages.props`` and the csproj parser previously
    # skipped versionless ``<PackageReference>`` rows. Round-9 ships
    # the CPM read-side parser
    # (``parsers/directory_packages_props.py``) + the version-
    # override walk + .sln-based discovery; the samples below
    # exercise those code paths against real CPM-using apps. Same
    # idea for Gradle's ``libs.versions.toml`` catalog — its
    # accessor-style references resolve via the new
    # ``parsers/gradle_version_catalog.py``.
    #
    # When these samples join the corpus they validate END-TO-END
    # (parse → resolve → OSV-match → finding row) and contribute
    # to per-ecosystem ρ measurement for NuGet / Maven exactly
    # like every other sample. They are NOT separate / parallel
    # measurement; they DENSIFY the existing per-eco signal pool
    # with deps the parsers couldn't reach before.

    # NuGet CPM. OrchardCore (BSD-3-Clause) is a modular ASP.NET
    # Core CMS — heavily MSBuild + CPM-based. The repo's
    # ``Directory.Packages.props`` carries ~140 PackageVersion
    # rows; every csproj declares versionless PackageReference
    # rows that previously resolved to nothing. With CPM read,
    # the corpus picks up the full ~140-dep tree per csproj.
