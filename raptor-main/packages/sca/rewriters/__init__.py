"""Rewriter registry — symmetric to ``packages/sca/parsers/``.

Each rewriter takes a manifest path + a list of ``RewriteEdit``
records and applies them in place (writing the file atomically),
returning a per-edit ``RewriteResult`` for the orchestrator. The
bumper subcommand dispatches edits via the registry; the legacy
``update.py`` flow keeps its own per-rewriter functions for now
(migrating those is a separate cleanup).

Adding a new rewriter:

1. Drop a module in this directory.
2. Decorate the entry-point with ``@register(filenames=..., predicate=...)``
3. The function takes ``(path: Path, edits: List[RewriteEdit])`` and
   returns ``List[RewriteResult]``. The function is responsible for
   reading, rewriting, and atomic-writing the file; it must be
   idempotent (re-running with the same edits should produce no
   change after the first run).
4. The ``@register`` decorator is mirrored from parsers/__init__.py
   so the operator/contributor model is uniform.

Failure modes:
* Edit doesn't match anything in the file → ``RewriteResult(applied=False,
  reason="not_found")``. The function still writes nothing for that
  edit but processes the rest.
* Edit's ``old_value`` doesn't match what's actually in the file →
  ``RewriteResult(applied=False, reason="value_mismatch: ...")``.
  Operators see the discrepancy so a stale bump plan doesn't
  silently corrupt the file.
* I/O errors → ``RewriteResult(applied=False, reason="error: ...")``.
