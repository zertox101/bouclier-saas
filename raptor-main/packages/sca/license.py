"""License-policy engine — emits :class:`LicenseFinding` rows when a
dependency's declared license matches operator-defined rules.

Two-stage flow:

  * :func:`enrich_licenses` — populate ``Dependency.declared_license``
    for ecosystems where it isn't supplied by the manifest itself.
    PyPI / npm parsers don't have license info (manifests pin
    versions, not licenses); registry metadata does. We only fetch
    when the dep's license is currently None and the operator
    cares (policy is non-empty).
  * :func:`evaluate` — walk the deps, classify each license against
    the policy, emit :class:`LicenseFinding` rows.

## Policy file format

YAML at ``<target>/.raptor-sca-license-policy.yml``::

    # Licenses operators explicitly allow — no finding.
    allow:
      - MIT
      - Apache-2.0
      - BSD-2-Clause
      - BSD-3-Clause
      - ISC

    # Licenses operators explicitly disallow — high severity.
    deny:
      - AGPL-3.0
      - AGPL-3.0-only
      - AGPL-3.0-or-later
      - SSPL-1.0
      - Commons-Clause

    # Licenses to flag as warning — medium severity.
    warn:
      - GPL-3.0
      - GPL-3.0-only
      - GPL-3.0-or-later

    # When a dep's license isn't in any list, this kind:
    #   "warn"  -> emit a warning finding
    #   "allow" -> permissive default (no finding)
    #   "deny"  -> strict default (every unmatched license is denied)
    default: allow

    # When a dep has no license at all (registry didn't provide):
    #   "warn"  -> info-severity finding ("license unknown")
    #   "deny"  -> high-severity finding (refused; explicit declaration required)
    #   "allow" -> no finding
    on_unknown: warn

The default policy (when no file exists) is permissive: allow is
empty, deny is AGPL-family + SSPL + Commons-Clause, warn is the
GPL-3 family, default=allow, on_unknown=warn. Operators committed
to compliance ship a tighter policy.
