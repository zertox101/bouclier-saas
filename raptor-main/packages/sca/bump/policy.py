"""``.raptor-sca-bump.yml`` operator policy file.

The bumper's defaults are sensible but unconfigurable today.
Operators wanting different behaviour — tighter rapid-release
window, longer maintainer-cooldown, skip certain locators
entirely — supply a policy file, either as the root
``.raptor-sca-bump.yml`` dotfile or, to keep CI/bot config out of
the project root, at ``.github/sca/raptor-sca-bump-policy.yml``
(mirrors ``.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml``). Root wins if both
exist. Schema is identical wherever it lives:

    # .raptor-sca-bump.yml
    skip:
      - locator: actions/checkout
        reason: "vendored a fork; bumps managed separately"
      - kind: from_image
        locator: docker.io/library/postgres
        reason: "schema migration blocker — manual coord required"
      - path: "test/data/**"
        reason: "test fixtures: versions are part of the test contract"

    thresholds:
      rapid_release_days: 14    # tighter than the default 30
      block_on_major: true       # major-version bumps require human review

Schema:

* ``skip``: list of match rules; a rule may constrain by
  ``kind`` (any/arg/from_image/yaml_image/gha_uses/helm_chart/
  git_submodule), ``locator`` (exact or ``*``-wildcard), and/or
  ``path`` (target-relative file glob, e.g. ``test/data/**`` — ``*``
  spans ``/``). A rule with several set matches only when ALL match.
  Matching candidates are NOT emitted by the walker.
* ``thresholds.rapid_release_days``: override the
  ``recent_publish`` detector's window (default 30; smaller
  values are stricter).
* ``thresholds.block_on_major``: when True, candidates whose
  target's major version differs from current's are forced to
  Block-tier verdict (operator review required).

Loading is fail-soft: a missing or malformed policy file
yields the default (no skips, default thresholds). Operators
get a warning log on parse failures but the bumper continues."""
