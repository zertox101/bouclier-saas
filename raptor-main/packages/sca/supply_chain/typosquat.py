"""Typosquat candidate detector.

For each direct dep, computes Damerau-Levenshtein distance against the
bundled per-ecosystem popular-names list. A name within distance 1 or
2 of a popular package is flagged as a candidate; an *exact* match is
trusted (the dep IS the popular package).

Limits & honesty:

- The bundled list ships ~80–100 names per ecosystem — far short of
  the 5k target the design doc anticipates. False negatives are
  inevitable for less-trafficked names. Add to ``data/popular/<eco>.json``
  to extend coverage; the file is JSON for that reason.
- We use a string-only check; ``lodash`` vs ``lodaash`` flags, but
  ``lodash`` (correct) vs ``loadsh`` (transposed) needs the Damerau
  variant — included.
- Scope-name typosquats are normalised: ``@types/node`` is compared
  against the popular list both as itself and as ``types/node`` (some
  attackers omit the ``@``). The package name kept on the finding is
  the original.
