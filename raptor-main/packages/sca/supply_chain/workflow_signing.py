"""Workflow-history signing-status check.

For each commit in the target repo that touched a GitHub Actions
workflow file (``.github/workflows/*.yml`` / ``.github/actions/**``
/ ``.github/dependabot.yml``), record the signature status.

Unsigned workflow commits are the entry vector for the Megalodon-
class attack (May 2026): an attacker with write access pushes a
forged-identity commit modifying workflow YAML, and the modified
workflow runs with the repo's secrets / OIDC tokens at the next
trigger.

Anomaly-shaped detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many teams don't enforce universal commit signing — both because
not every developer has signing configured, and because GitHub's
"co-author" trailer can demote a fully-signed commit to "Partially
verified" if the co-author lacks a verified key. Flagging every
unsigned commit on such a repo would flood the report.

We instead compute the signing RATE across recent workflow-touching
commits and dispatch based on that:

  signing rate ≥ 70%  (norm is to sign)
    — Emit one finding PER unsigned commit at ``medium`` severity.
      These are anomalies against the established norm; an
      attacker pushing forged-identity commits would stand out.

  0% < signing rate < 70%  (norm is mixed)
    — Emit ONE hygiene finding at ``info`` severity describing the
      rate. Per-commit flagging would be noisy because the norm
      isn't to sign.

  signing rate == 0%  (no signing at all)
    — Emit ONE governance finding at ``info`` severity recommending
      ``git config commit.gpgsign true`` + the repo's branch-
      protection "Require signed commits" option.

The ``signed-ish`` count treats both ``G`` (verified) and ``U``
(partially-verified / untrusted-key) statuses as signed. This
matches GitHub's UI: both render as a "Verified" or "Partially
verified" badge — visible to a reviewer, and both raise the
attacker's bar above "no signing key needed." ``B`` / ``X`` /
``Y`` / ``R`` / ``E`` (problematic signature) statuses also
count as signed for rate purposes — they're not invisible
forgeries.

``%G?`` placeholder semantics (from git docs):
  G — good signature, key trusted in keyring
  U — good signature, key not in trusted keyring
  B — BAD signature (verification failed)
  X — good signature, key expired
  Y — good signature, expired key (note: distinct from X)
  R — good signature, revoked key
  E — cannot check (missing public key)
  N — no signature present

The detector is best-effort: returns no findings when the target
isn't a git repository, git binary is missing, or no workflow
files exist.
