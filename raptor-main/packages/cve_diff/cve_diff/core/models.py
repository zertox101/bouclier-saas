"""
Typed invariants for the pipeline.

The reference project's post-mortems boil down to a handful of type confusions
that a strict dataclass layer would have caught at construction time:

- Bug #1: OSV's `introduced` is a *version marker*, not a commit SHA. Treating
  it as a commit produced 3.5-year diffs. Fixed here by exposing `IntroducedMarker`
  and `CommitSha` as distinct NewTypes — a discoverer that returns an
  introduced version cannot accidentally flow into the diff command.
- Bug #2: `zip(repos, fixes, introduceds)` de-synchronised under pagination.
  `PatchTuple` makes the triple atomic.
- Bug #12: `git diff HEAD` was used as a silent fallback. `RepoRef` has no
  default for `fix_commit`; a None slips through the type checker.

    Output of the extract stage — what the report layer consumes.

    `shape` is the classification of the changed file set:
      - "source"         : at least one source file changed (the normal case)
      - "packaging_only" : only packaging / version manifest files changed
      - "notes_only"     : only release-notes / changelog files changed
    A non-"source" shape is a signal that the CVE's discovered repo is likely
    a downstream packaging mirror rather than the upstream fix source.

    `files` is a per-file structured view (populated by `extract_diff`).
    Empty tuple when the extractor fallback path is used.

    `consensus` is the 2-method pointer-consensus dict (see
    `cve_diff/report/consensus.ConsensusReport.to_dict()`). May be
    None when consensus is skipped (e.g., during the bench's tight
    inner loop where it'd inflate cost). Surfaced in the per-CVE
    markdown report and the OSV `database_specific.consensus` field.

    `extraction_agreement` is the cross-check between the clone-based
    diff (this bundle) and a parallel ``extract_via_api`` pull on the
    same ``(slug, sha)`` for GitHub-hosted commits. Captures whether
    two independent extraction methods agree on the file set / byte
    count of the diff. Keys when present:
      - ``method``: ``"clone+api"`` (always — single key today)
      - ``files_clone`` / ``files_api``: int file counts
      - ``paths_overlap``: float in [0, 1] — Jaccard of touched paths
      - ``bytes_clone`` / ``bytes_api``: int diff bytes
      - ``bytes_pct_diff``: float — relative size delta (clone-side
        baseline). Loose ±5% tolerance is the agreement threshold.
      - ``api_truncated``: bool — True when API response capped at
        ~300 files; comparison is then advisory only.
      - ``verdict``: ``"agree"`` / ``"partial"`` / ``"disagree"`` /
        ``"single_source"``.
    None when no second source was attempted (non-GitHub URL, API
    fallback path itself, or feature disabled).
