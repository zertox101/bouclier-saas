"""Third diff source: fetch the forge's raw ``<sha>.patch`` URL.

Non-git, non-API-JSON. Three forges expose a unified-diff endpoint:

  GitHub:  ``https://github.com/<slug>/commit/<sha>.patch``
  GitLab:  ``https://gitlab.com/<slug>/-/commit/<sha>.patch``
  cgit:    ``<base>/commit/?id=<sha>&format=patch``

This is the forge's own ``git format-patch`` output served as static
text — distinct from both the clone (git CLI) and the API JSON
(parsed-file + synthesized) paths. It can disagree with the API JSON
on whitespace, line endings, binary truncation, or path normalization,
so it adds real triangulation rather than just confidence.

Crucially, this is the **first second-source coverage for cgit**
(kernel.org). Before this module, cgit-hosted CVEs had only the clone
as a single source — the agreement signal was unavailable.

Best-effort: any failure (404, timeout, parse error) returns ``None``.
The auxiliary check must never abort the pipeline.

# ``diff --git a/<before> b/<after>`` — captures the post-fix path.
#
# Pre-fix the regex was `^diff --git a/.+? b/(.+)$`. Two issues:
#
#   1. The lazy `.+?` for the BEFORE path can backtrack into the
#      ` b/` separator if the AFTER capture has trouble matching
#      downstream — for paths containing the literal substring
#      ` b/` (a path component that happens to be `b`,
#      e.g. `dir/b/file.c`), the regex matches at an unexpected
#      ` b/` instead of the canonical separator. Git's
#      `diff --git` line is documented as always using `a/...`
#      and `b/...` prefixes; the separator is the FIRST ` b/`
#      after `a/`.
#
#   2. The greedy `(.+)$` capture grabs everything to end-of-line,
#      including trailing whitespace. Git itself never emits
#      trailing whitespace on this header line, but operator-
#      edited / copy-pasted patch files can carry stray trailing
#      spaces or `\r` from Windows CRLF, turning the captured
#      path into `path/file\r` which then fails downstream
#      file-existence checks.
#
# Switch to non-whitespace classes for both halves: `diff --git`
# paths can't contain spaces anyway (git would have escaped them),
# and `\S+` for the after-path capture trims trailing whitespace /
# CR naturally.
