"""GitHub Commits API as a fallback source-extraction method.

When ``git clone`` + ``git diff fix^..fix`` fails (acquisition error,
oversized repo, "unadvertised object" git server), this module
extracts the same diff content via ``GET /repos/{slug}/commits/{sha}``.

**Bug #12 guarantee** (no HEAD fallback):
- The GitHub API endpoint requires a fully-qualified SHA. Passing
  literal ``"HEAD"`` returns 404. Passing a tag returns 422.
- We assert SHA-format BEFORE calling — same regex as
  ``commit_resolver.is_valid_sha_format`` — so an upstream bug that
  tries to extract from a tag/branch is rejected at the boundary.
- The diff is always between ``commit.parents[0].sha`` and
  ``commit.sha`` — i.e., ``fix^..fix``, identical to the clone-based
  extractor. We do NOT call any "compare against HEAD" or "diff
  against latest" variant of the API.

Predecessor lesson (CLAUDE.md): the deleted ``recovery/diff_methods.py``
+ ``edge_case_handler.py`` totaled 1000+ LOC for multi-method
extraction and never out-performed the one-liner ``git diff``. We're
NOT re-porting that. This module adds ONE fallback method (the
GitHub API) targeted at the specific failure shape we still see
(clone fails for repo-protocol or size reasons).
