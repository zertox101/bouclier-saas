"""Cross-check the clone-based diff against alternative extractors.

Three diff sources may run for a single CVE:

  1. **Clone** — `git clone` + `git diff fix^..fix` (always, unless
     the clone itself failed).
  2. **Forge API JSON** — GitHub `/repos/{slug}/commits/{sha}` or
     GitLab `/projects/.../repository/commits/{sha}/diff`. JSON, not
     git on the client. Skipped on cgit / unsupported forges.
  3. **Forge `.patch` URL** — the raw ``git format-patch``-style text
     served by the forge (added 2026-04-30, see
     `extract_via_patch_url`). Distinct from the API JSON path; works
     on cgit too.

Two-of-three or three-of-three agreement gives the report layer the
"independent sources matched the captured patch" signal — the user's
primary integrity check.

Cost is near-zero: shared `lru_cache` with the agent's existing
`gh_commit_detail` calls, plus one extra HTTP fetch for the patch URL.
Truncation-aware: GitHub API caps at ~300 files per commit; when that
hits, the API source is downweighted rather than treated as an outlier.
