"""
The single orchestrator for the agentic-first discover pipeline.

Stages, with a disk-budget gate at every entry:

    agent_discover  →  acquire  →  resolve  →  diff  →  render

The `agent_discover` stage is an Anthropic-SDK tool-use loop (see
`cve_diff/agent/`). It replaces the deterministic 7-gate scorer chain
and the recovery-as-fallback layer. Agent output is type-checked by
three invariants only (``agent/invariants.py``):
  (1) ``is_valid_sha_format`` + ``PatchTuple`` construction
  (2) ``commit_exists(slug, sha)`` + minimal URL shape check
  (3) ``check_diff_shape`` — post-extract, via ``_check_shape``

No hardcoded slug / tracker / keyword list anywhere on this path.

Diff semantics unchanged: the diff body is always ``fix^..fix``; OSV's
``introduced`` marker is preserved for provenance only.

Failure modes surface as typed exceptions (``DiscoveryError``,
``AcquisitionError``, ``IdenticalCommitsError``, ``UnsupportedSource``,
``AnalysisError``) that the CLI maps to exit codes.
