"""Per-CVE flow-log writer — shared between `cve-diff run` and `cve-diff bench`.

Promoted from ``cli/bench.py::_write_flow`` so both code paths produce
the same per-tool-call artifacts:

  ``<cve>.flow.jsonl``  one JSON line per tool call (structured)
  ``<cve>.flow.md``     human-readable rendering (uses ``render_flow``)

Best-effort: never raises. The caller's pipeline must complete cleanly
even if the report write fails (out-of-disk, permission, etc.).

      ``<cve>.clone.patch``       — git-clone-extracted unified diff
      ``<cve>.<method>.patch``    — one per second-source extractor.
                                    ``<method>`` is e.g. ``github_api``,

    each and runs `diff` to see exactly which bytes differ. The
    clone diff is also embedded in the ``<cve>.md`` report; the
    second-source diffs were previously dropped on the floor.

    ``api_diff_text`` + ``api_method`` are kept as a backward-compatible
    shorthand for the single-extra case. New callers should use
    ``extras`` to pass any number of ``(method, diff_text)`` tuples.
