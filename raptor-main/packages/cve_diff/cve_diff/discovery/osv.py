"""
OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) discoverer.

Primary source of metadata in the cascade (50% success rate on the reference
project's measured runs, no API key, no effective rate limit).

Wraps :mod:`packages.osv` (shared OSV.dev wire-format client + parser)
with cve-diff's domain mapping: ``OsvRecord`` → ``DiscoveryResult``
with ``PatchTuple`` candidates extracted from references and GIT
ranges. Wire-format parsing + HTTP transport live in :mod:`packages.osv`.

Behaviour preserved:

1. Parsing is a classmethod on plain dict input so it can be unit-tested
   against fixture JSON without going through HTTP.
2. Only `fixed` events produce tuples. `introduced` is treated as advisory
   metadata only; `introduced: '0'` is the OSV sentinel for "from beginning
   of history" and is dropped. This enforces the lesson that ruined Bug #1
   at the type boundary — see core/models.py.

Behaviour changed (this rewire, 2026-05-02):

* The legacy ``POST /v1/query`` 404-fallback is dropped. The body shape
  the previous code sent (``{"queries": [...]}``) didn't match OSV's
  ``/query`` endpoint contract, so the fallback returned ``None``
  deterministically in production while looking like a working path in
  tests via mocked responses. Removing it eliminates the latent
  inconsistency. OSV's ``/vulns/<id>`` endpoint resolves CVE / GHSA /
  DSA aliases server-side, so a separate alias-lookup pass isn't needed.
