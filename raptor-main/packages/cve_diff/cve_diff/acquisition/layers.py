"""
Acquisition layers: turn a `RepoRef` into a local directory with both commits.

Two strategies, tried in order (plan's cascade):

1. TargetedFetchLayer — ``core.git.fetch_commit`` per wanted SHA. Works for
   old CVEs whose fix commits aren't reachable from a depth-1 clone of HEAD.
   ~70% of wins on the reference project's measured runs.

2. ShallowCloneLayer — ``core.git.clone_repository`` with progressive depth
   (100, 500). Recovers when the server refuses direct commit fetches
   (common for older GitLab instances / some mirrors). The 2000-depth tier
   was dropped on the 2026-04-20 bench: median 64s worst-case and 3/40
   timeouts. If the SHA isn't reachable at 500 it almost never is at 2000.

3. FullCloneLayer — ``core.git.clone_repository`` with ``depth=None``.
   Last-resort for old git servers that reject ``fetch <unadvertised-sha>``
   (e.g. BootHole / GRUB2 on git.savannah-style hosts) and for deep cherry-
   picks not reachable at depth=500.

Pre-rewire each layer shelled out to ``git clone`` / ``git fetch`` directly
via ``subprocess.run``. That bypassed the egress proxy + sandbox isolation:
a malicious server-side hook on a forked clone (or a compromised mirror)
ran with full host network and filesystem access. The layers now route
every git transport through ``core.git.{clone_repository, fetch_commit}``,
which engages the sandbox + hostname-allowlisted egress proxy used by the
rest of RAPTOR.

Dropped from the reference port: the ``TemporalAcquisitionLayer`` (deleted
branches, 925 LOC of workarounds) — the plan calls it "marginal value" and
drops it from Phase 1.
