"""Coccinelle (spatch) dispatch for /understand --hunt — C/C++ targets.

Implements the same ``HuntDispatchFn`` shape as
``hunt_dispatch.default_hunt_dispatch`` so the substrate (multi-model
orchestrator + ``VariantAdapter``) treats it as a drop-in alternative
backend. The difference is what does the work:

  default_hunt_dispatch  → LLM with sandboxed Read/Grep/Glob tools
                          (works on any language, but text-grep
                          precision on C is poor; one variant search
                          is N LLM tool-call rounds)
  cocci_hunt_dispatch    → 1 LLM call to translate the natural-language
                          pattern into a Coccinelle semantic patch
                          (.cocci rule), then ``spatch`` does the
                          AST-level matching deterministically

Cocci is C/C++-only. For other-language targets the dispatch returns
an error variant the substrate filters cleanly into ``failed_models``,
matching how other-shape failures (provider-construction error, bad
repo path) surface today.

Cost / latency profile:
  * 1 LLM round-trip per call, output capped to a small .cocci file
    (~200 tokens). Compares to the LLM-grep dispatch's typical 10-30
    Read/Grep tool rounds plus a final analysis turn.
  * spatch wall-clock dominates: 5-30s on a typical kernel-sized
    subdirectory, deterministic regardless of model temperature.
  * Result quality: AST-level matches, no false hits from text-pattern
    coincidence. Trade-off: pattern must be expressible in SmPL —
    structural patterns work cleanly, semantic ones (data-flow
    properties) need to defer to other tools (CodeQL / IRIS) or fall
    back to the LLM dispatch.

This dispatch is opt-in via ``--hunt-tool=cocci`` on the /understand
CLI. ``--hunt-tool=auto`` (the default once wired) picks cocci when:
  (a) ``spatch`` is on PATH (``packages.coccinelle.runner.is_available``)
  (b) repo contains C/C++ source files (heuristic: any .c/.h/.cpp/.hpp)
otherwise falls through to the default LLM dispatch.

_RULE_GEN_SYSTEM = """\
You are a Coccinelle (spatch) rule writer. Your sole job is to translate
a natural-language description of a vulnerability/code pattern into a
Coccinelle semantic patch (.cocci rule) that finds instances of that
pattern in C source code.

Output format: ONLY the rule text, between ```cocci and ``` fences.
No prose, no preamble.

Rule shape — follow this template exactly:

    @r@
    <metavariable declarations, e.g. "expression e1, e2;">
    position p;
    @@
    <pattern with @p attached to the syntax-element you want to flag>

Hard requirements:
  * Exactly ONE named rule block named ``@r@``.
  * The rule MUST declare a ``position p;`` metavariable and attach
    ``@p`` to the construct you want flagged
    (e.g. ``strcpy@p(e1, e2)`` or ``foo@p(...)``).
  * NO ``script:python`` or ``script:ocaml`` blocks. The dispatcher
    auto-injects a Python reporting harness that reads ``r.p`` and
    emits the structured output the parser expects. Adding your own
    script block prevents the harness from being injected and the
    matches won't be parsed.
  * NO transformations (no ``+`` / ``-`` lines that would rewrite
    code). Matching only.
  * Prefer false negatives over false positives. If the pattern is
    ambiguous, encode the strictest reading.
  * Use ``<+...+>`` only when the body is intended to be flexible.

If the pattern needs information that is not structurally available
in C (e.g. taint flow, runtime values, "is this attacker-controlled"),
output exactly:

    UNTRANSLATABLE: <one-sentence reason>

The dispatcher surfaces that and the operator can fall back to the
LLM-grep hunt or use a dataflow tool (CodeQL / IRIS).

Example (for "find all strcpy calls"):

    @r@
    expression e1, e2;
    position p;
    @@
    strcpy@p(e1, e2)

    key — substrate convention for ``failed_models`` capture.

    ``sandbox`` (default True) runs spatch through ``core.sandbox.run``

    ``script:python`` blocks that execute as part of the spatch
    process. The dispatch's rule text is LLM-emitted, and the LLM's
    pattern input is operator-influenced — combined, that's
    arbitrary-code-exec inside the process invoking spatch. The
    sandbox locks reads to ``target``, blocks network, and uses a
    fake $HOME so even a compromised rule can't exfiltrate. Tests
    pass ``sandbox=False`` for speed; production callers should
    take the default. Falls back to plain ``subprocess.run`` on
    hosts where the sandbox isn't available (non-Linux/macOS,
