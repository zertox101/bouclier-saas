## Overview

RAPTOR is an autonomous security testing framework that combines static analysis, dataflow validation, and binary fuzzing with LLM-powered vulnerability analysis. It aims to autonomously identify, validate, and exploit security vulnerabilities with minimal human intervention.

The framework operates in three distinct modes:
- **Source Code Analysis Mode**: Static analysis using Semgrep and CodeQL with deep dataflow validation
- **Binary Fuzzing Mode**: Coverage-guided fuzzing using AFL++ with GDB crash analysis
- **Crash Analysis Mode**: Autonomous root-cause analysis using rr record-replay, function tracing, and code coverage

RAPTOR leverages Large Language Models to provide intelligent analysis, distinguishing true vulnerabilities from false positives, and generating working exploits and secure patches.



## Core Concept

Traditional security tools generate thousands of findings but lack context and exploitability assessment. RAPTOR addresses this by:

1. **Finding Vulnerabilities**: Using industry-standard tools (Semgrep, CodeQL, AFL++)
2. **Validating Exploitability**: Deep dataflow analysis to separate true positives from false positives
3. **Understanding Attack Paths**: Complete source-to-sink tracing with sanitiser effectiveness analysis
4. **Automating Exploitation**: Generating working exploit code and secure patches
5. **Providing Intelligence**: Detailed reasoning, bypass techniques, and remediation guidance

The key innovation is **dataflow validation** - using LLM reasoning to determine if a finding is truly exploitable by analysing:
- Whether the source is attacker-controlled
- Whether sanitisers can be bypassed
- Whether the code path is reachable
- What the attack complexity would be



## Architecture

RAPTOR follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Components

### 1. Static Analysis

**Tools**: Semgrep, CodeQL
**Purpose**: Pattern-based and dataflow-aware vulnerability detection

- **Semgrep**: Fast pattern matching for common vulnerability patterns (OWASP Top 10, secrets, security audit)
- **CodeQL**: Deep semantic analysis with complete dataflow tracking from source to sink
- **SARIF Output**: Standard format (SARIF 2.1.0) for interoperability

**Key Feature**: CodeQL dataflow extraction captures the complete attack path including intermediate sanitisation steps, enabling intelligent validation.

### 2. LLM Analysis

**File**: `packages/llm_analysis/agent.py`
**Purpose**: Autonomous vulnerability analysis with reasoning

**Capabilities**:
- Parse SARIF findings from static analysis tools
- Read vulnerable code with surrounding context
- Extract and enrich dataflow paths with actual source code
- Perform deep validation of exploitability
- Analyse sanitiser effectiveness and identify bypass techniques
- Generate working exploit proof-of-concepts
- Create secure patches with explanations

**Dataflow Validation** (Phase 4):
The most critical component. For each vulnerability with a dataflow path:
1. **Source Control Analysis**: Determines if source is attacker-controlled or hardcoded
2. **Sanitiser Effectiveness**: Analyses each sanitiser in the path for bypass potential
3. **Reachability Analysis**: Assesses if attacker can trigger the code path
4. **Exploitability Assessment**: Determines true exploitability with confidence scoring
5. **Impact Analysis**: Estimates CVSS score and potential damage

This validation catches 60-80% of false positives and provides detailed reasoning for each verdict.

### 3. CodeQL Integration

**Files**: `packages/codeql/agent.py`, `packages/codeql/query_runner.py`
**Purpose**: Advanced semantic analysis with dataflow tracking

**Features**:
- Supports multiple languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, C/C++, C#, Go)
- Extracts complete source-to-sink dataflow paths
- Identifies sanitisers and transformations in dataflow
- Provides visualisation of dataflow paths in terminal
- Real-time status updates during scanning

**Dataflow Path Structure**:
```
SOURCE: request.getParameter("id")
  ↓
STEP 1: Sanitiser - input.trim()
  ↓
STEP 2: Transformation - buildQuery(input)
  ↓
SINK: executeQuery(query)
```

### 4. Exploit Feasibility Analysis

**Package**: `packages/exploit_feasibility/`
**Purpose**: Determine what's actually exploitable before wasting time on impossible approaches

**Problem Solved**: Traditional tools (checksec, readelf) show what protections exist but not what's actually possible. This package answers:
- Can I write to that GOT entry? (Full RELRO blocks both GOT AND .fini_array)
- Will my ROP chain work? (strcpy null bytes break x86_64 addresses)
- Does %n work? (glibc 2.38+ may block it - tested empirically)

**Key Features**:
- Empirical verification (actually tests %n, doesn't just check version)
- Input handler constraint analysis (strcpy, fgets, scanf bad bytes)
- ROP gadget filtering by bad bytes
- Honest verdicts (Likely exploitable, Difficult, Unlikely)
- Context persistence for long sessions

**Usage**:
```python
from packages.exploit_feasibility import analyze_binary, format_analysis_summary

result = analyze_binary('/path/to/binary')
print(format_analysis_summary(result, verbose=True))
```

**Integration**: Run after finding vulnerabilities, before attempting exploitation. Saves hours by identifying blocked techniques upfront.

See [exploit-feasibility.md](exploit-feasibility.md) for detailed guide.

### 5. Binary Fuzzing

**Tool**: AFL++
**Purpose**: Coverage-guided fuzzing to discover crashes

**Capabilities**:
- Single and parallel fuzzing instances
- Automatic crash deduplication by signal
- Support for AFL-instrumented and non-instrumented binaries (QEMU mode)
- Autonomous corpus generation using LLM analysis of binary strings
- Goal-directed fuzzing (target specific vulnerability types)
- Early termination on crash threshold

**Autonomous Corpus Generation**:
Instead of requiring manual seed inputs, RAPTOR can:
- Analyse binary with `strings` to detect input formats
- Generate format-specific seeds (JSON, XML, HTTP, CSV)
- Create goal-directed seeds for specific vulnerabilities (stack overflow, heap corruption, etc.)
- Detect command-based inputs and wrap seeds appropriately

### 6. Binary Analysis

**Tool**: GDB
**Purpose**: Crash debugging and context extraction

**Capabilities**:
- Automated GDB analysis of crash inputs
- Stack trace and register dump extraction
- Disassembly at crash location
- Crash type classification (stack overflow, heap corruption, use-after-free, etc.)
- AddressSanitizer (ASan) detection and parsing
- Memory layout analysis

**ASan Support**:
When binaries are compiled with ASan (`-fsanitize=address`), RAPTOR automatically:
- Detects ASan output in crash dumps
- Extracts precise error types (heap-buffer-overflow, stack-overflow, etc.)
- Provides source-level stack traces with line numbers
- Uses ASan diagnostics instead of debugger output for better accuracy

### 7. LLM Provider Abstraction

**Location**: `core/llm/`
**Purpose**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers

**Supported Providers**:
- Anthropic Claude (API)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (API)
- Ollama (local models)

**Configuration**: Via environment variables
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Recommended for exploit generation
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here     # Alternative
# OR use Ollama for local/testing
```

## LLM Provider Selection

### Quality Comparison

| Provider | Analysis | Exploit Code | Patch Quality | Cost | Use Case |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|------|----------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | Excellent | Compilable C code | Excellent | ~£0.01/finding | Production |
| **OpenAI GPT-4** | Excellent | Compilable C code | Excellent | ~£0.01/finding | Production |
| **Ollama (local)** | Good | Often broken | Good | Free | Testing/Learning |

### Recommendations

**For Production Exploit Generation**:
- Use Anthropic Claude (best overall quality)
- Or OpenAI GPT-4 (excellent alternative)
- Both produce compilable, working exploit code

**For Testing and Analysis**:
- Ollama works well for vulnerability analysis and triage
- Ollama acceptable for exploitability assessment
- Ollama NOT recommended for exploit code generation (often produces syntactically invalid C)

**Exploit Generation Requirements**:
Working exploit code requires capabilities that distinguish frontier models from local models:
- Deep understanding of x86-64/ARM memory layout
- Correct shellcode encoding (valid assembly, NULL-byte avoidance)
- ROP chain construction with valid gadget addresses
- Proper pointer arithmetic and type handling
- Knowledge of heap allocator internals (glibc malloc, tcache)

Local models (Ollama) frequently generate code with:
- Invalid escape sequences in shellcode
- Incorrect pointer arithmetic
- Non-existent libc function calls
- Malformed assembly syntax
- Chinese characters in preprocessor directives (seriously)

### Configuration

```bash
# Recommended: Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

# Alternative: OpenAI GPT-4
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Testing: Ollama (local)
# No API key needed, just install Ollama
# Warning: Exploit code quality is unreliable
```
