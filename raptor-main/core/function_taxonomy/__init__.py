"""Shared taxonomy of function-name categories with security significance.

One source of truth for "dangerous string function", "exec sink", "parser
entry point", etc. — consumers (packages/binary_analysis,
packages/exploit_feasibility) compose the union they need from these
primitive frozensets. Replaces three previously-divergent lists:

  - packages/binary_analysis/radare2_understand._DANGEROUS_IMPORTS
  - packages/exploit_feasibility/constants.{COMMON,INPUT,STRING_TERMINATING}_FUNCTIONS
  - packages/binary_analysis/radare2_understand._DANGEROUS_MACOS_SUBSTRINGS

Curation policy (why some "obvious" entries are missing):

  - **Ubiquitous functions are deliberately excluded from the categories
    that drive fuzz-prioritisation signal.** `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`,
    `open`, `fopen`, `read`, `write`, `printf`, `fprintf`, `vprintf`
    appear in essentially every binary — if every binary "imports a
    dangerous function" then the signal value is zero. These functions
    are added back where they ARE useful (e.g. `COMMON_FUNCTIONS` for
    ROP target enumeration in exploit_feasibility) by the consumer's
    composition, not by this module.

  - **The CVE-shape determines category, not the function family.**
    `snprintf` is in `FORMAT_STRING_FUNCS` rather than
    `STRING_OVERFLOW_FUNCS` because its dominant CVE shape is
    format-string when the format is tainted; the bounded-size param
    actually prevents the classic overflow.

  - **"Safe" variants are NOT in the dangerous categories.** Microsoft's
    `wcscpy_s` / `wcsncpy_s` (`_s` suffix = explicit size param) and
    safe temp-file APIs (`tmpfile`, `mkstemp`) are deliberately omitted.
    Banned-by-design APIs (`mktemp`, `tempnam`) ARE included.

  - **Category membership is closed-list, not pattern-matched.** macOS
    Swift/ObjC symbols use substring matching (see
    `MACOS_DANGEROUS_SUBSTRINGS`) because demangled Swift names embed
    type/parameter info that breaks exact equality. Everything else is
    plain function-name equality.

Per-consumer compositions live in the consumer files
(`packages/binary_analysis/radare2_understand.py`,
`packages/exploit_feasibility/constants.py`) so the consumer's intent
is visible at the use site.

# === Bounded-string functions with classic overflow CVE shapes ===
# Note: snprintf/vsnprintf and their wide-char cousins are NOT here —
# their dominant CVE shape is format-string (see FORMAT_STRING_FUNCS),
# not overflow. The bounded-size param actually prevents the classic
# CWE-120 overflow.
STRING_OVERFLOW_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    # No bounds checking at all
    "strcpy", "strcat", "sprintf", "vsprintf",
    "gets",  # banned by C11 Annex K, still found in legacy code

    # Bounded but off-by-one / no-NUL-termination CVEs are common
    "strncpy", "strncat",

    # BSD variants — same risk shape as strcpy
    "stpcpy", "stpncpy",

    # Wide-char variants — overflow patterns identical to char* siblings
    "wcscpy", "wcsncpy", "wcscat", "wcsncat",

    # Windows ANSI/Unicode equivalents — Microsoft has both
    # safe (`_s` suffix) and unsafe variants. The unsafe ones below
    # have the same risk shape as strcpy.
    "lstrcpyA", "lstrcpyW", "lstrcatA", "lstrcatW",
})


# === scanf-family parsing ===
# Format-string driven input parsing — overlaps conceptually with
# FORMAT_STRING_FUNCS (when the format is tainted) and with INTEGER_
# PARSE_FUNCS (when %d / %u is the only parser). Kept as own category
# because the analysis pattern differs from atoi/strto* (scanf has its
# own bounded vs unbounded %s rules).
SCAN_FAMILY_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "scanf", "vscanf", "sscanf", "fscanf", "vsscanf", "vfscanf",
    "wscanf", "swscanf",
})


# === Size-tainted memory copy operations ===
# memcpy is itself ubiquitous, but the pattern
# `memcpy(buf, attacker_data, attacker_size)` is THE classic CVE so
# the import IS signal — every binary uses memcpy, but a binary that
# uses memcpy on caller-supplied size is worth fuzzing more aggressively.
MEMORY_COPY_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "memcpy", "memmove", "bcopy",
    # Wide-char variants
    "wmemcpy", "wmemmove",
})


# === Format-string sinks (rare/distinguishing only) ===
# printf / fprintf / vprintf are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED — they're
# ubiquitous so importing them is zero signal. Consumers that need
# exhaustive format-string detection (e.g. exploit_feasibility's
# format-string constraint analysis) should compose this set with
# the common-ones in their own file.
#
# snprintf / vsnprintf are included here (not in STRING_OVERFLOW)
# because their dominant CVE shape is format-string-when-tainted,
# not overflow (the size param prevents the overflow).
FORMAT_STRING_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({

# === Size-tainted allocation ===
# malloc / realloc REMOVED (ubiquitous). Strong-signal entries:
#   calloc:  nmemb * size integer-overflow CWE-190 → CWE-122
#   alloca:  stack-allocation CWE-770, unbounded if size is tainted
# The remaining entries are uncommon enough that the import is still
# signal even though their individual CVE history is thinner.

    "posix_memalign", "aligned_alloc",
    "valloc", "memalign", "pvalloc",
})


# === Network ingestion / server-side indicators ===
# read REMOVED (ubiquitous; network ingestion uses recv* explicitly).
# accept / bind / listen are server-side markers — different semantic
# from recv* but bundled together because both answer "is this binary
# doing network I/O" (fuzz-priority interest is similar).
NETWORK_INGEST_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "recv", "recvfrom", "recvmsg", "recvmmsg",

})


# === Stream / file input (non-ubiquitous variants) ===
# Buffered line/delimiter input + non-trivial fd-level reads. The
# ubiquitous variants (read, fread, fopen) are excluded per the
# module-wide policy — they're in every binary so their import is
# zero fuzz-priority signal. The variants kept here are deliberate
# choices: someone using getline/getdelim is doing structured parsing,
# someone using pread/readv is doing positional or scatter-gather I/O,
# someone using fgets is reading bounded lines (common in CLI parsers
# and network protocol handlers). gets() lives in STRING_OVERFLOW_FUNCS
# (banned API) and is therefore excluded here to keep categories
# disjoint.
STREAM_INPUT_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "fgets", "fgetws",
    "getline", "getdelim",
    "pread", "preadv", "readv",
})


# === Process boundary inputs (env) ===
# argv / envp are MAIN parameters, not function calls — they appear
# in source code but not in import tables, so they're outside this
# module's grain (function-name catalog). The function-call shaped
# attacker-controlled equivalent is plain getenv. secure_getenv and
# getauxval are NOT here — they're context markers, not sources
# (see PROCESS_BOUNDARY_MARKERS below).
PROCESS_BOUNDARY_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "getenv",
})


# === IPC primitives where less-privileged peers can write ===
# Shared memory + message queues. Deliberately excluded:
#   * mmap — most usage is file-backed read-only, not attacker-
#     controlled shared memory, and you cannot distinguish from the
#     call site alone (CVE-shape-determines-category policy).
#   * shm_open — returns an fd; the actual attacker-data read goes
#     through mmap (excluded above) or read (ubiquitous), so flagging
#     shm_open alone yields a category with no live read primitive.
#   * pipe / mkfifo — setup primitives, not read primitives. The
#     actual attacker-data read happens via read() on the resulting
#     fd (ubiquitous).
IPC_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "shmat", "shmget",
    "mq_receive", "mq_timedreceive",
    "msgrcv",

# === Kernel / userspace boundary (kernel-side only) ===
# Functions called by KERNEL CODE (drivers, syscalls, kernel modules)
# to read attacker-controlled data from less-privileged userspace.
# These do NOT appear in user-space binary import tables, so the
# binary-fingerprint and fuzz-priority consumers ignore them; the
# value is for source-code analysis of kernel modules and driver
# audits where userspace pointers are the canonical L1 source. The
# `_*` / `__` prefixes are kept because Linux kernel symbol naming
# uses them at the call site (no need for fortified() expansion).
#
# Covers three sub-families:
#   1. Bare-copy primitives (copy_from_user, get_user, raw / inatomic)
#   2. Allocator wrappers that copy in one call (memdup_user et al.)
#   3. iovec / pages interfaces for scatter-gather + DMA paths

    "get_user_pages", "get_user_pages_fast",
})


# === Device-control entry points (driver command interfaces) ===
# ioctl-style entry points often carry attacker-supplied command values
# or request structs. They are function-name shaped, unlike argv/envp,
# so they belong in the shared catalog. Source-side scanners may treat
# them as L1 context; import/fuzz-priority consumers can opt in only when
# this signal is meaningful for their target class.
DEVICE_CONTROL_FUNCS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "ioctl", "unlocked_ioctl", "compat_ioctl",
})


# === Process boundary markers (suid-context signal) ===
# NOT a source set — separate to avoid contaminating consumers that
# expect "attacker-controlled input lands here". These are *signals*
# that the author was aware of suid safety (or that suid context
# matters). Their *return values* are either NULL (secure_getenv in
# suid) or kernel-supplied (getauxval). A static analyser uses these
# to weight the suspicion of co-located plain getenv calls, not as
# direct taint sources.
