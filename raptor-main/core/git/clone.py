"""Sandbox-routed git clone + targeted fetch.

Two entry points:

  - ``clone_repository(url, target, depth=1)`` — shallow or full clone.
  - ``fetch_commit(repo_dir, url, sha, depth=5)`` — targeted fetch of a
    specific commit into an existing or fresh git directory. Useful when
    a full clone would be wasteful: the caller already knows the SHA and
    wants only that commit's history. Older CVE fix commits are often
    not reachable from a depth-1 clone of HEAD, so progressive-fetch
    cascades use this.

Both wrap their ``git`` subprocess in ``core.sandbox.run_untrusted``:

  - the egress proxy pinned to the small set of hostnames the URL
    allowlist permits (github.com / gitlab.com plus the known
    object-storage CDNs they redirect to);
  - landlocked filesystem so the git process can only write into
    the target / repo directory;
  - sanitised env (``RaptorConfig.get_git_env()`` — clears
    HTTP_PROXY / NO_PROXY etc., sets GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 and
    GIT_ASKPASS=true so a malformed-credential prompt can't hang
    the run);
  - bounded timeout (``RaptorConfig.GIT_CLONE_TIMEOUT``).

Pre-#210, scanner.py and recon/agent.py both implemented variants of
clone. Post-centralisation everyone calls through here.

      - hostname allowlist: connections to anything outside
        ``proxy_hosts`` are refused at CONNECT;
      - private-IP / loopback / link-local block: hostnames that
        resolve to RFC 1918 / 127.0.0.0/8 / 169.254.0.0/16 / etc.
        are refused regardless of the allowlist (closes the SSRF
        and DNS-rebinding surface);
      - HTTPS-only transport: SSH / git:// schemes can't tunnel
        through HTTPS-CONNECT.

    Args:
        url: HTTPS git URL. Must have a hostname and no userinfo.
            ``http://`` is rejected because the in-process egress
            proxy is HTTPS-CONNECT exclusively.
        proxy_hosts: hostname allowlist passed to the proxy. Must be
            non-empty, and bare hostnames only (no ``host:port``
            entries — the URL's port is unrelated to the allowlist
            check). The URL's host must also appear here (defence
            in depth — the proxy would refuse anyway).
        timeout: per-call wall-clock cap (seconds; default 20).
            Tighter than ``RaptorConfig.GIT_CLONE_TIMEOUT`` because
            ls-remote returns a ref-list, not whole repos.

    Returns:
        ``[(sha, ref), ...]`` — e.g.
        ``[("abc...", "refs/heads/main"), ("def...", "refs/tags/v1")]``.
        Lines whose first column isn't a SHA shape are skipped
        defensively.

    Raises:
        ValueError: URL fails scheme/userinfo/hostname checks, or
            ``proxy_hosts`` is empty, or URL host isn't in
            ``proxy_hosts``.
        RuntimeError: sandbox unavailable, or ``git ls-remote``
            exited non-zero.
        subprocess.TimeoutExpired: ``timeout`` elapsed before git
            returned. Propagated unchanged so callers handling the
            ``(RuntimeError, TimeoutExpired)`` tuple cover both
            shapes — same contract as ``clone_repository`` /
            ``fetch_commit``.
        FileNotFoundError: ``git`` binary not on PATH inside the
            sandbox. Caller-trusted (CI environments always have
            it); propagated for diagnosability.
