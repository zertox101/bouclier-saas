"""JSON utilities — one-shot load/save + TTL'd disk cache.

Re-exports are LAZY (PEP 562) so `import core.json` doesn't drag in
`core.json.cache` (and its `JsonCache` class definition + dataclass
machinery) for consumers that only need `load_json` / `save_json` /
`load_json_with_comments` from `core.json.utils`.

Pre-fix:
    from .cache import CacheEnvelope, JsonCache, MISSING, TTL_FOREVER
    from .utils import load_json, save_json, load_json_with_comments

That eagerly imported both submodules on every `import core.json`,
even though F046's wider audit found `CacheEnvelope` and `TTL_FOREVER`
have ZERO production callers outside `core.json.cache` itself — they
are public sentinel/value-type surface kept for future consumers, not
for the current caller set.

Mirrors 94712e5 (`fix(core/__init__): lazy re-exports via PEP 562
__getattr__`) at sibling package depth. Same shape, same rationale.

`__all__` is unchanged; `dir(core.json)` still surfaces the full set
for tab-completion. Direct submodule imports
(`from core.json.cache import JsonCache`) continue to work and are
the preferred form when the consumer knows it needs cache machinery.
