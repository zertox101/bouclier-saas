"""Capability fingerprint for a single binary.

A *fingerprint* is a small, stable, comparable JSON shape that
summarises what a binary is capable of doing — its dangerous
imports bucketed by capability family (exec / network / parser /
etc.), plus binary metadata (arch / bits / format) and a content
hash for the bytes.

Two fingerprints with the same shape have the same capability
surface; two with different shapes have different attack surfaces.
The fingerprint is the primitive every higher-level capability-
aware feature builds on:

  * **Drift detection**: store last-seen fingerprint per image
    ref; diff against fresh extraction on each scan.
  * **CI gate**: assert all images' capability_buckets ⊆ allowed.
  * **SBOM property**: embed alongside the image component for
    audit / VEX context.
  * **Bump finding evidence**: structured payload inside
    ``SupplyChainFinding.evidence``.

Scope boundary
- The fingerprint is import-table-based only — it surfaces "what
  is this binary capable of calling into" via the dynamic symbol
  table. Cross-reference-aware analysis ("which of this binary's
  own functions actually call into execve") requires
  ``BinaryUnderstand`` from :mod:`packages.binary_analysis.
  radare2_understand` and its expensive ``aaa`` step. That signal
  has a different output shape and lives in a different
  abstraction; the fingerprint primitive deliberately stays
  cheap-to-compute substrate.

The schema is versioned (``schema_version``). Bumps when adding
fields that change diff semantics; consumers reject mismatched
versions.
