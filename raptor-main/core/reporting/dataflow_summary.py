"""Console renderer for the IRIS dataflow_validation summary block.

Shared between `/agentic` (raptor_agentic.py) and `/analyze`
(packages/llm_analysis/agent.py) so both surfaces show the same
Tier 1/2/3/4 + path_conditions telemetry. Pre-extraction this
lived inline in raptor_agentic.py only — operators running
/analyze standalone after /scan didn't see whether IRIS validated
findings, whether the LLM populated path_conditions, or whether
Tier 4 SMT fired.

The helper returns a list of pre-formatted lines (with leading
indent baked in) rather than printing directly. Callers print
them — easier to test, easier to splice into different output
contexts (markdown report, log streamer, etc.).
