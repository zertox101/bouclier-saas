"""Tests for the IRIS dataflow_validation console renderer.

Shared between /agentic and /analyze — pre-extraction this lived
inline in raptor_agentic.py only, leaving /analyze operators
unable to see Tier 4 / path_conditions telemetry. These tests
pin both the populated and the no-op cases so neither surface
silently regresses.
