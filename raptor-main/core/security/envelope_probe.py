"""Pre-run canary probe for envelope compatibility.

Before dispatching real findings, send a single controlled request
through the same dispatch path to verify the model understands the
envelope contract. The probe uses known-good content that the attacker
cannot influence — if the model fails, it's genuinely incompatible,
not being tricked.

Usage (in orchestrator, after model resolution):

    from core.security.envelope_probe import probe_envelope_compatibility

    result = probe_envelope_compatibility(model_config, profile, dispatch_fn)
    defense_telemetry.set_probe_result(model_config.model_name, result.compatible)
    if not result.compatible:
        profile = PASSTHROUGH  # fall back for this model

    """Send a canary probe through the dispatch path.

    ``analysis_model`` is the :class:`ModelConfig` (or anything with a
    ``.model_name`` attribute) that the orchestrator picked. We pass it
    *unchanged* to ``dispatch_fn`` because that's what the production
    dispatch_fn expects (its 5th argument lands in
    ``client.generate_structured(model_config=...)`` which reads
    ``.max_context`` etc.). Pre-2026-05-04 the probe passed
    ``model_name`` (a string) here, which surfaced as ``'str' object
    has no attribute 'max_context'`` once a model was actually probed
    via the live external-LLM path.

    dispatch_fn must accept (prompt, schema, system_prompt, temperature, model)
    and return a DispatchResult (or raise on failure). This is the same
    signature used by dispatch_task() — pass the same function.

    Returns a ProbeResult with .compatible indicating whether the model
    handled the envelope correctly.

    When ``strict=True``, raises ``RuntimeError`` instead of returning a
    failed ``ProbeResult``, so callers that do not check ``.compatible``
    cannot silently continue. The strict contract applies UNIFORMLY to
    both failure paths inside this function:

    1. ``dispatch_fn(...)`` itself raises (e.g. ``TimeoutError``,
       connection-refused, transient HTTP 5xx) — the underlying
       exception is chained via ``raise ... from e`` so callers
       introspecting the cause still see the original error.
    2. ``dispatch_fn`` returns successfully but the response fails
       envelope evaluation (probe canary leaked, tag forgery
       detected, etc.) — raises with the evaluator's error message.

    The original ``strict=True`` landed (W36.B / F058) covering only
    path 2; path 1's coverage closed in W36.K.3 / F058-gap. A
    ``strict=True`` caller can now treat the absence of an exception
    as "envelope confirmed compatible" without separately checking
    ``.compatible``.
