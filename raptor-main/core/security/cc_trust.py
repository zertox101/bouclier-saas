core/security/cc_trust.py

Trust check for target-repo Claude Code config files.

Called by every entry point that runs Claude Code against an untrusted repo:
    - bin/raptor (via libexec/raptor-cc-trust-check)
    - raptor_agentic.py
    - packages/codeql/build_detector.py

Returns True if the caller should refuse to dispatch CC.
Prints findings to stdout when anything noteworthy is found; silent when safe.

Trust override: a process-wide flag set by entry points when `--trust-repo`
is parsed. `bin/raptor` passes the override via argv to the libexec wrapper;
raptor_agentic.py calls `set_trust_override(True)` after argparse.
`build_detector.py` (and any other in-process caller) reads the flag via
`check_repo_claude_trust()` without needing its own argparse plumbing.

Deliberately NOT driven by an env var. Env would be vulnerable to injection
via a target repo's `settings.json` `env` dict (CC propagates that into its
subprocesses, including later RAPTOR invocations), which could forge trust
without the user's consent. The flag is the only source of trust.

Files inspected:
    .claude/settings.json, .claude/settings.local.json, .mcp.json

Dangerous fields (block):
    settings:  apiKeyHelper, awsAuthHelper, awsAuthRefresh, gcpAuthRefresh
               hooks.<Event>[].hooks[].command (type == "command")
               env.<KEY> for KEY in _DANGEROUS_ENV_VARS (LD_PRELOAD, EDITOR, ...)
               env.RAPTOR_* (attempts to forge our own control env vars)
    .mcp.json: mcpServers.<name>.command (stdio servers)
               mcpServers.<name> with unknown transport
    structural: symlinks, oversized, malformed (all → block)

Informational (no block):
    .mcp.json: url-only servers (sse/http transport)
