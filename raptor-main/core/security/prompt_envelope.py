"""Construct LLM prompts that quarantine untrusted content from instructions.

Untrusted content (target-repo source, scanner output, GitHub bodies, prior
LLM output) is segregated from RAPTOR's own instructions through layered
defences applied at prompt-construction time:

- Envelope tags around each untrusted block, with a per-call random nonce so
  attacker-supplied closing tags cannot escape the envelope.
- Spotlighting datamarking (Hines et al., arXiv 2403.14720): a sentinel
  token interleaved with whitespace inside the envelope so a mimicked
  closing tag is still detectable.
- Slot discipline: identifiers (file paths, rule IDs) are passed through
  named slots, never interpolated into prompt prose.
- Control-character sanitisation reusing log_sanitisation.escape_nonprintable.
- Markdown / HTML / data-URI stripping inside untrusted blocks to defend
  against exfiltration via auto-fetch markup.
- Role placement: untrusted bytes go in the user role, never system.
- Per-model defence profile selects which layers apply for a given model.

The companion module `prompt_defense_profiles` chooses which defences to
enable for a given model. This module performs the construction; profile
selection is the caller's responsibility.

Threat-model context: see project_anti_prompt_injection memory entry. The
central premise from "The Attacker Moves Second" (arXiv 2510.09023) is that
single-layer defences fail under adaptive attack. This module composes
layers; the caller must pair it with output-schema validation and
capability isolation for full coverage.

    Public utility for any prompt-envelope defence — both build_prompt's
    internal pipeline and any caller building its own envelope (e.g. the
    hypothesis_validation runner, IRIS dataflow validation) should route
    untrusted content through this helper before interpolating it into
    a prompt.

    Two structural forgery vectors are neutralised:

    1. **Envelope-tag forgery.**  After newline-preservation was added,
       an attacker can place a fake closing tag on its own line — visually
       identical to the real one from the model's perspective.  The nonce
       makes real boundaries unguessable, but models pattern-match visually
       rather than parsing XML.  The leading ``<`` of any sequence matching
       our envelope tag vocabulary (``</untrusted-``, ``<slot``,
       ``<document_content>``, etc.) is replaced with ``&lt;``.  Bracket-
       and line-marker variants are similarly broken without removing the
       semantic content.

    2. **Markdown-heading forgery.**  Trusted prompt regions use
       ``## Section`` headings to scope content (e.g. ``## Strategy:``,
       ``## Bug-class lenses``).  An attacker who controls a field that
       echoes into the trusted region — like ``finding["file_path"] =
       "src/foo.py\\n## INJECTED"`` — can forge a heading the model
       parses as a peer of the real ones.  Each line-start ``#`` run is
       prefixed with ``\\`` so visual heading recognition fails while the
       semantic content (Python ``# comment``, shebang ``#!/...``, C
       ``#include`` etc.) remains readable.
