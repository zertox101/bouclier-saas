"""Model-family detection and cross-family checker selection.

When schema validation rejects an LLM response, the caller can re-issue the
request through ``validate_response``'s ``llm_call`` callback. The
*Attacker Moves Second* finding (arXiv 2510.09023) shows that a single
model's output parser is bypassable under adaptive attack at >90% ASR.
Routing the retry through a model from a different family raises the bar
from "bypass one parser" to "bypass two unrelated parsers simultaneously".

This module provides the family-detection helpers callers compose with
``validate_response``. It does not change ``validate_response`` itself —
the cross-family routing is a caller concern (which model is the producer,
which models are available as checkers).

Family is the deployment vendor / training lineage, not the prompt-defence
profile shape. They overlap by prefix because vendor identifiers do — see
``prompt_defense_profiles._BY_PREFIX`` for the same prefix list. They are
separate concepts: a profile selects envelope shape and which defences
apply; a family selects who trained the model so that a "different family"
checker is meaningfully independent.
