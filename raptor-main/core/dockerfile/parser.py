r"""Tokenise a Dockerfile into an ordered list of :class:`Instruction`.

Each instruction carries:
  * ``directive`` — the keyword (``FROM``, ``RUN``, ``COPY``, …),
    upper-cased so consumers don't repeat the case-folding.
  * ``args`` — the raw argument string (with line-continuation
    backslashes collapsed). Consumers parse this further as
    needed; we don't pre-tokenise into a structured form because
    the right shape depends on the directive (``RUN`` is a shell
    fragment, ``FROM`` is an image reference, ``COPY`` is a
    flag-and-paths list, etc.).
  * ``stage_name`` — when the instruction belongs to a multi-stage
    build, the ``AS <name>`` clause from the active ``FROM`` line.
    ``None`` means "default stage" (no ``AS`` declared).
  * ``line`` — 1-based line number of the directive's first line,
    so consumers emitting findings can point at the right source.
  * ``raw`` — the original source span (with line continuations
    preserved). Used by consumers that re-emit / patch the file.

Behaviours:
  * Line continuations (`` \ \n ``) are collapsed into one
    logical line.
  * Comments (``#`` at start of a line, ignoring leading
    whitespace) are skipped, except the parser-directive comments
    (``# syntax=...``, ``# escape=\\``) which we currently
    ignore — their behaviour is dockerfile-frontend-specific and
    not relevant to the consumers we serve.
  * Heredoc bodies (``<<EOF`` / ``<<-EOF``) are kept intact in the
    instruction's ``args`` text — consumers don't need to peer
    inside them today.
