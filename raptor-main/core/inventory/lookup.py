            made absolute paths fail to match: `os.path.relpath(

            relpath-against-cwd result, and `lookup_function` silently
            returned ``None`` — the agentic enrichment pipeline lost
            function metadata for findings whose source carried abs
            paths (most CodeQL output).

    Returns:
        Function dict from the checklist, or None if no match.
        Prefers exact match (line within line_start..line_end).
        Falls back to closest function starting before the line, but only
        when the candidate has no line_end (can't determine boundaries).

        ValueError: if ``file_path`` is absolute (or a file:// URI) but
            ``repo_root`` is empty.
