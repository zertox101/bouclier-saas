"""Function-level reachability resolver.

Answers "is qualified-function ``X.Y.Z`` actually called from this
project?" using the call-graph data captured by
:mod:`core.inventory.call_graph` and stored in the inventory
artefact.

The resolver is language-agnostic. The first-cut data producer
(``call_graph.extract_call_graph_python``) is Python-only, so
non-Python files contribute neither evidence-for nor evidence-
against — they're skipped as "no data". Other-language consumers
get added when a producer for that language ships.

## Verdict semantics

  * ``CALLED`` — at least one call site in non-test project code
    demonstrably resolves to the queried qualified name via its
    file's import map.
  * ``NOT_CALLED`` — no call site resolves to the qualified name,
    AND no file with a tail-name candidate has an indirection flag
    (``getattr`` / ``importlib.import_module`` / ``__import__`` /
    wildcard import) that could plausibly mask such a call.
  * ``UNCERTAIN`` — no call site resolves, but at least one file
    that could plausibly call this function uses indirection. We
    refuse to claim NOT_CALLED in that case.

Consumers translate UNCERTAIN to "do not downgrade severity" — it's
the safe choice for security work, where false-confidence in
non-reachability is the worst outcome.

## Out of scope (UNCERTAIN by design — documented, not "fix
later")

  * Decorator-driven dispatch, plugin registries, dynamic
    ``setattr`` injection.
  * Method dispatch on subclassed instances (e.g. subclass
    ``requests.Session``, override ``get``). This is *module-
    function* reachability, not method-resolution-order
    reachability.
  * String-based reflective dispatch beyond ``getattr`` /
    ``importlib`` / ``__import__`` (eval / exec / pickle / RPC).
  * Cross-package re-exports the resolver hasn't been told about.
    A package that re-exports ``requests.utils.extract_zipped_paths``
    as ``mypkg.helpers.ezp`` won't be matched on the
    ``mypkg.helpers.ezp`` qualified name unless the inventory
    captures the re-export — and at first cut, it doesn't.
  * Cross-file string-literal ``getattr`` dispatch. ``file_a.py``
    holds ``getattr(obj, "foo")(...)`` where ``obj`` is an instance
    of a class in ``file_b.py``. The masking signal is per-file,
    and ``file_a.py`` is not in the static reverse closure of
    ``file_b.py::Klass.foo`` (the getattr call site isn't a
    resolved edge), so the dead-island claim against ``Klass.foo``
    can't see ``file_a``'s confounding dispatch. UNCERTAIN-safe
    only when ``Klass.foo`` is reachable through some non-getattr
    edge; pure-getattr-only consumers of an internal API are the
    blind spot.

If the consumer cares about any of those, CodeQL's call-graph
queries are the right tool — at the cost of a ~30s DB build.
This resolver is meant to be sub-second.

## Test-file exclusion

By default, files matching a test path pattern (``tests/``,
``test_*.py``, ``*_test.py``, ``conftest.py``) are NOT counted as
evidence-for. ``mock.patch("requests.get")`` mentions a qualified
name without calling it; counting test-file uses as CALLED would
keep severities pinned high purely because the project has good
test coverage. Pass ``exclude_test_files=False`` to opt out.

    many (dep × affected_function) queries every SCA function-level
    tier emits. Pre-fix the bare loop scanned all ~30k Grafana files

# Adjacency primitives — 1-hop callers / callees
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``function_called`` (above) answers "is some call site in the project
# resolved to ``X``?" — a *forward 1-hop* query specialised for external
# targets. Consumers like ``/audit`` need a richer set of primitives:
# given a project-internal function, who calls it and what does it call?
# Given a CVE-affected dep function, walk back to find every caller chain
# in the project.
#
# The primitives below are language-agnostic and operate on the same
# inventory shape ``function_called`` consumes. They share a per-
# inventory adjacency index built lazily on first query and memoised
# weakly so batch queries (every function in the project) amortise.
#
# **Node identity.** A node in the call graph is one of:
#
#   * :class:`InternalFunction` — a project-defined function. Identity:
#     ``(file_path, name, line)``. The line disambiguates same-name
#     overloads / nested defs / methods of different classes that
#     happen to share a name.
#
#   * :class:`ExternalFunction` — a dotted dep-name resolved via the
#     containing file's import map. Identity: ``qualified_name``.
#
# **Method-call policy.** When a call site's chain is rooted in a name
# that *isn't* in the file's import map — e.g. ``self.foo()``,
# ``obj.foo()`` — we can't know which class's ``foo`` was invoked. Two
# directions, two policies:
#
#   * **Caller direction (``callers_of``)**: over-inclusive. We add the
#     enclosing function as a candidate caller of every project
#     ``foo`` we know of. False positives in caller lists show up as
#     visible noise; missing a real caller can lead a downstream
#     consumer to demote a real vulnerability. Bias toward inclusion.
#
#   * **Callee direction (``callees_of``)**: under-inclusive +
#     UNCERTAIN flag. We don't enumerate every possible ``foo`` in the
#     project as a callee; instead we record an indirection-style
#     uncertainty entry on the result. ``/audit``'s context slice
#     would otherwise be flooded with non-callees.
#
# The asymmetry is deliberate. Documented; not "fix later".

# Chain tails recognised as framework registration calls — the JS /
# Go pattern where a handler is passed as an identifier argument to a
# routing or middleware-registration method. For
# ``app.get("/x", handler)``, the chain tail is ``get`` and ``handler``
# is the registered function. The set is curated against:
# Express / Fastify / Koa / Hono (HTTP verb methods + ``use`` + ``route``),
# Go net/http (``Handle``, ``HandleFunc``), gin / echo (capitalised HTTP
# verbs + ``Use`` + ``Group``), chi (mixed-case verbs + ``Method`` /
# ``MethodFunc`` / ``Mount``). The chain-length-2 gate (matching
# ``_decorators_indicate_framework_dispatch``'s philosophy) keeps bare
# ``get(...)`` / ``use(...)`` calls from being treated as registration:
# they're far more likely user-defined helpers than framework calls.
#
# FALSE-POSITIVE awareness:
#   * ``map.get(key)`` shape: any chain ending in ``get`` matches.
#     Mitigation: tail-set excludes the most generic verbs that double
#     as Map/Set accessors (``set``, ``has``); registered HTTP verbs
#     (``get``/``post``/etc.) cannot be cleanly disambiguated without
#     receiver-type tracking. Accepted: a function passed as the 2nd
#     arg to a ``somethign.get(...)`` call would be promoted as
#     framework_registered — but in practice ``map.get`` takes 1
#     argument (the key), and 2-arg ``.get(key, default)`` calls
#     don't pass identifier-function arguments. False-positive
#     promotion costs accuracy on dead-code findings (the consumer
#     skips a demotion that might have been correct); silencing
#     real frameworks costs false negatives. Bias toward
#     admitting the framework case.

# Entry-point forward reachability (U7) — "is this reachable from a real
# entry, or only from an orphaned/dead chain?"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``function_called`` answers the 1-hop "does anything call this name?" — it
# reads CALLED for a function whose only caller is itself dead (a cluster of
# mutually-calling functions with no external entry: the dead-island). This
# adds the transitive answer: a function is reachable-from-entry iff it OR
# some function in its reverse-closure is an entry point. If none is, and
# the entry model is closeable for the language and no indirection could
# hide an entry edge, it's NO_PATH_FROM_ENTRY.
#
# Entry model per language (what can be invoked from outside the project's
# own call graph):
#   * any language: framework_callable / framework_registered (runtime
#     dispatch), and a function named ``main``.
#   * C/C++: non-``static`` functions (external linkage — another TU may
#     call them). SOUND + closeable: the static/extern split is total.
#   * Go: exported (Capitalized) functions.
#   * Rust: ``pub`` functions.
#   * JS/TS: exported functions.
#   * Java: ``public`` methods.
#   * Python: module-level public (non-``_``) functions.
#   * unknown language: treat every function as an entry → never flags
#     (false-negative-safe).
#
# Completeness: where the entry model isn't a closed signal, or an ancestor
# file uses call-masking indirection (getattr / reflection / func-like
# macros) that could hide an entry edge, return UNCERTAIN rather than claim
# NO_PATH_FROM_ENTRY. Surface-only consumers treat UNCERTAIN as "analyze".

# Per-language reachability profile — the declarative entry model. Adding a
# language's entry behaviour is one PROFILES entry; the entry accessors below
# derive from it instead of inline ``if language ==`` chains.
#
#   entry_model:
#     "sound"     — closed linkage/visibility signal; a NO_PATH_FROM_ENTRY
#                   verdict is trustworthy (C/C++ static-vs-extern, Go
#                   exported, Rust pub). entry_reachability may return NO_PATH.
#     "heuristic" — entries identifiable but the model isn't closed (dynamic
#                   dispatch / reflection); NO_PATH would be surface-only.
#                   (No language uses this yet — the Python/Java dead-island
#                   coverage units flip it on; today nothing is "heuristic".)
#     "none"      — no visibility-based entry signal; functions fall through
#                   to UNCERTAIN + the 1-hop NOT_CALLED logic (py/js/java/…).
#   visibility_entry: how a function's visibility marks it an external entry —

# given a target, which project functions can reach it through ANY chain
# of internal calls? Or symmetrically: from a set of entry points, what's
# the full forward-reachable set?
#
# All three primitives walk the same definitive call-graph edges captured
# by the adjacency index in pass 2. **Uncertain edges are NOT walked.**
# A consumer wanting "could-possibly-reach" coverage should drill into
# the boundary using ``callers_of`` / ``callees_of`` directly to inspect
# the 1-hop uncertain neighbours; closure semantics are "demonstrably
# reachable".
#
# This split is deliberate: the SCA / audit consumer that wants to demote
# severity for unreachable code wants to be conservative — empty closure
# under definitive-only walk, plus a non-empty 1-hop uncertain frontier,
# means "we don't know" and severity should NOT be demoted. The two
# halves of the answer come from separate primitives.
#
# **Termination at External nodes.** Forward closure expands
# InternalFunction nodes only — ``ExternalFunction`` is recorded in the
# closure when reached but its callees are unknown to the index (it's
# a dep). Reverse closure has no analogous distinction: every caller of
# anything is by definition an Internal project function (we don't
# index how the project's deps call each other).
#
# **Cycles.** Visited-set BFS handles cycles trivially. We don't surface
# strongly-connected-component structure — consumers that need it can
# layer it on top of a closure result.
