"""Persistent on-disk cache for reachability adjacency indices.

Sibling to :mod:`core.inventory.reachability`. The substrate's
in-process cache (``_INDEX_CACHE``) hits once per inventory
identity inside a single process; this module persists the
built index across processes so a cold start doesn't pay the
~300ms build cost every time.

Threat model: cache files live at ``~/.cache/raptor/reachability/``
mode 0600, dir mode 0700. An attacker with same-UID write access
can already do worse (rewrite ``~/.bashrc``, etc.), so the
trust boundary matches :mod:`core.sandbox.calibrate`. Pickle is
acceptable here under the same model. Corrupt / unparseable
cache files are silently treated as misses; the caller rebuilds.

Fingerprinting: the inventory's per-file ``sha256`` is the
authoritative content hash (build_inventory computes it). We
fold every file's sha256 into a single fingerprint plus a
schema-version constant so an index-shape change invalidates
all old cache entries without manual cleanup.

When the inventory lacks ``sha256`` on its files (test
fixtures, hand-built inventories), the fingerprint returns
``None`` and the persistent layer auto-disables — the in-
process cache is still active, just no disk-spill.

API:

  * :func:`compute_fingerprint` — ``inventory -> Optional[str]``
  * :func:`load_index`            — ``fingerprint -> Optional[_AdjacencyIndex]``
  * :func:`save_index`            — ``(fingerprint, index) -> None``
  * :func:`clear_cache`           — drop everything; returns count
  * :func:`cache_dir`             — accessor for tests / status output

Module is intentionally underscore-prefixed in the package
namespace; consumers go through :mod:`core.inventory.reachability`.

# V4 (2026-05-16): per-language alias canonicalisation extended
# ``qualified_to_internal`` with ``<pkg>.<Class>.<method>`` entries
# for Java/C#/PHP/Rust/JS-TS/Ruby method definitions. An old V3
# cache returned ``InternalFunction(verdict=UNCERTAIN)`` for
# class-qualified queries that the new build would have resolved
# to ``CALLED``/``NOT_CALLED`` — a real correctness regression on
# stale caches, so this is a bump-worthy change.
#
# V5 (2026-05-17): index pass-2 fully-qualified-call fast-path
# promotes C++ ``ns::Util::helper()`` chains (and any other
# language's fully-qualified shape) from method_match_overinclusive
# to definitive forward/reverse edges. An old V4 cache would have
# returned these callers in ``method_match_overinclusive`` instead
# of ``definitive`` — same correctness shift, bump for parity.
# V6 (2026-05-23): _AdjacencyIndex grew a `framework_registered`
# field (S2: JS / Go function-as-argument framework registration
# via _FRAMEWORK_REGISTRATION_TAILS + CallSite.argument_identifiers).
# An old V5 cache returns _AdjacencyIndex instances without the
# new attribute — AttributeError on access by is_registered_via_call.
# V7 (2026-05-26): _AdjacencyIndex grew `override_methods` (CHA virtual-
# dispatch candidates). Same hazard: an old pickle lacks the attribute.
# V8 (2026-05-28): override_methods now seeded for Go methods (every
# Go method is a structural-interface virtual-dispatch candidate). Changed
# index contents; a V7 pickle would serve stale verdicts.
# V9 (2026-05-28): Rust now uses tree-sitter item extraction (impl→
# class assoc) + trait impls record the trait as a base → override_methods
# gains Rust trait-impl methods. Changed index contents; bump to rebuild.
