"""Test-fixture-circularity detection for security findings.

Implements the mechanical part of D-5 (test-harness circularity) per the
``/audit`` design — see ``stage-d-ruling.md`` and upstream
exploitation-validator#1 proposal 2 (CB-5 narrow case).

A finding is considered "test-harness-derived" when:
  1. its source file matches a test-fixture path pattern, AND
  2. the function the finding lives in is NOT reachable from any
     production entry point (i.e. only test code can drive it).

Both halves are needed: a finding in ``tests/conftest.py`` that's
ALSO callable from a production endpoint is a real bug (someone
left a debug surface in prod). A finding outside ``tests/`` that's
only reachable from test code is also a fixture-derived FP, but
the path-pattern check is the cheap pre-filter — most fixture
content lives in conventional paths.

The reachability gate is delegated to
:mod:`core.inventory.reachability`, which already has a
``exclude_test_files=True`` mode that excludes calls *from* test
files when answering "is this called?". A function with no
non-test callers gets ``NOT_CALLED``.

Verdict semantics:
  * ``true`` — fixture-path matches AND reachability says NOT_CALLED.
    The finding's preconditions originate in test code that can't
    drive production. Stage D's [D-5] rubric will rule this out
    with ``severity_demoted_to: INFORMATIONAL``.
  * ``false`` — fixture-path doesn't match, OR reachability says
    CALLED (a production caller exists). The finding is treated as
    real; D-5 doesn't fire.
  * ``candidate`` — fixture-path matches but reachability is
    UNCERTAIN (indirection-flag in a plausibly-calling file) OR
    the inventory lacks reachability data for this function. The
    LLM must verify before D-5 fires.

The verdict and supporting evidence are written to the finding so
downstream consumers (Stage D's LLM, /agentic's pre-flight skip,
the SARIF/report layer) all see the same signal.
