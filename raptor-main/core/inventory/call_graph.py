"""Per-file call-graph extraction.

Companion to :mod:`core.inventory.extractors`, which captures
function *definitions*. This module captures the data needed to
answer "is qualified function ``X.Y.Z`` actually called from this
project?":

  * **Import map** — for each imported name available in the file's
    namespace, the dotted target it resolves to. ``import requests``
    → ``{"requests": "requests"}``. ``import os.path as p`` →
    ``{"p": "os.path"}``. ``from requests.utils import
    extract_zipped_paths as ezp`` → ``{"ezp":
    "requests.utils.extract_zipped_paths"}``.

  * **Call sites** — every call expression in the file, recorded as
    the attribute chain of the callee (``foo.bar.baz()`` →
    ``["foo", "bar", "baz"]``), plus the line and the enclosing
    function name. We don't record arguments or the call's value;
    the resolver only needs "did this name get called".

  * **Indirection flags** — set bits indicating the file does
    something the static analysis can't follow:
      * Python: ``getattr(mod, "name")``, ``importlib.import_module``,
        ``__import__``, wildcard ``from x import *``.
      * JavaScript / TypeScript: dynamic ``import(<var>)``,
        ``require(<var>)``, bracket dispatch ``obj[<var>](...)``,
        ``eval`` / ``new Function(...)``.
      * Go: dot import ``. "pkg"`` (analog of wildcard),
        ``reflect`` package usage (any reflective dispatch).
      * Java: wildcard imports ``import x.*``, ``Class.forName``
        / ``Method.invoke`` reflective dispatch.

Indirection flags are file-scoped (not per-call) because once any
of them is present, every NOT_CALLED claim about that file becomes
UNCERTAIN. Tracking per-call would let the resolver narrow the
uncertainty, but the resolver consumers (SCA reachability, codeql
pre-filter) treat UNCERTAIN as "don't downgrade severity" anyway —
finer granularity buys nothing.

Pure-AST. We never import / require / eval the target, never look
at any filesystem outside the source tree. String-shape only.

Languages today: Python (stdlib ``ast``) + JavaScript /
TypeScript + Go + Java (all tree-sitter-driven for non-Python;
gracefully empty when the grammar isn't installed). The resolver
in :mod:`core.inventory.reachability` is language-agnostic.

@dataclass
class CallSite:
    """One call expression in a file.

    ``chain`` is the attribute chain of the callee. ``foo.bar.baz()``
    → ``["foo", "bar", "baz"]``. Plain function call ``f()`` →
    ``["f"]``. Calls with non-name callees (e.g. ``(lambda x: x)()``,
    ``f()()``, ``arr[0]()``) are NOT emitted — we have no qualified
    name to match against.

    ``caller`` is the name of the lexically-enclosing function /
    method, or ``None`` for module-level calls. The resolver doesn't
    use this today, but it's cheap to capture and useful for future
    "transitively reachable from entry-point X" queries.

    ``receiver_class`` is the name of the enclosing class when this
    call site is a ``self.X()`` or ``cls.X()`` call and the chain is
    length-2 (e.g. ``["self", "foo"]``). The reachability resolver
    uses this to narrow ``method_match`` candidates by class
    hierarchy: a ``self.foo()`` inside ``class B`` can't be calling
    ``class C.foo`` if B and C are unrelated. ``None`` everywhere
    else — module-level call, non-self chain, longer chain than the
    safe-narrow case.

    ``argument_identifiers`` is the list of bare-identifier
    arguments at this call site. For ``http.HandleFunc("/x",
    handler)`` the list is ``["handler"]``; for ``app.use(mw1,
    mw2)`` it is ``["mw1", "mw2"]``; for ``f("string", 42)`` it
    is ``[]``. Used by the reachability resolver to detect
    function-as-argument registration (Express / Fastify / Koa /
    net/http / gin / echo route handlers) — a function passed as
    an argument to a recognised registration method is callable
    via that framework's runtime dispatch even though no static
    call site invokes it directly. Populated by extractors that
    bother — empty list when the extractor hasn't been taught to
    record arguments (backwards-compatible default).

    ``receiver_type`` is the DECLARED type of the call's receiver when
    the chain is a length-2 instance call (``recv.m()``) and ``recv`` is
    a simple identifier whose declared type is resolvable in scope — a
    method parameter, a local variable, or a field of the enclosing
    class. ``Handler h = ...; h.handle()`` → ``"Handler"``. The simple
    (unqualified) type name is stored, generics/arrays stripped to their
    base. Used by the reachability resolver's typed-dispatch resolution
    (Tier 2) to bind ``recv.m()`` to the implementors in ``recv``'s
    declared-type hierarchy instead of every same-name override. ``None``
    when the receiver type isn't statically resolvable (chained call,
    ``var`` without an explicit type, generic type variable, etc.) — the
    resolver then falls back to the type-free CHA over-approximation.

    methods when surfacing framework-callable entry points.

    ``decorators`` is a list of attribute chains, one per
    ``@decorator`` line. ``@functools.cache`` →
    ``[["functools", "cache"]]``. ``@app.route("/x")`` →
    ``[["app", "route"]]`` (the call arguments aren't stored;

    same-file class names for narrowing; unresolved bases (imported

    inclusive rather than drop a real caller.

    ``methods`` lists the methods defined at depth 1 inside the

    Go's nominal rule is "the last path segment is the package
    identifier", but two well-known conventions make that wrong
    often enough to bite SCA's function-level reachability on
    real-world Go code:

      * **Versioned modules.** ``github.com/foo/bar/v2`` is a Go-
        modules path-versioning convention. The package name is
        almost always ``bar`` (the pre-version segment), not ``v2``
        — callers write ``bar.SomeFunc(...)``. Bare-last-segment
        binding misses every call to such a package.
      * **Hyphenated dir names.** Go identifiers can't contain
        hyphens, so a package at ``github.com/foo/bar-utils``
        declares its package name without the hyphen (usually
        ``barutils``, sometimes a shorter form). Bare-last-segment
        gives ``"bar-utils"`` which no real Go call site uses.

    Both conventions are common — versioned modules grow with
    every major release post-2019; hyphenated dirs hit any
    multi-word package name. Adding the convention-aware aliases
    converts MISSED call edges into resolved ones without false
    positives (the aliases coexist with the literal last-segment
    binding; the resolver only matches what's actually called).

    Returns a list (LAST segment first, then aliases). Caller
    binds in order without overwriting existing entries — first
    import wins, matching Go's compile-time duplicate-name rule.

    chain matching follows imports, not type-tracking. Operators
    will see correct verdicts for STATIC method calls and
    CLASS-level access (``Util.staticMethod()``,
    ``Cls.method()``) but instance-method calls show the variable
    name in the chain and won't bind to the type's qualified
    name. Same limitation as Go interface dispatch and Python
    method-on-instance — out of scope; CodeQL is the right tool
    when type-aware reachability matters.

    Ruby shapes:

# ===========================================================================
# C
# ===========================================================================
#
# C semantics differ from the higher-level languages above:
#
#   * No module system. ``#include "foo.h"`` is preprocessor text
#     substitution; there's no qualified-name space the linker
#     exposes by file. ``imports`` records included headers as
#     ``basename(header) -> header path`` so the resolver can
#     match ``foo`` → ``foo.h`` at the call site.
#
#   * Function pointers are first-class. ``fp()`` where ``fp`` is a
#     local variable is statically indistinguishable from a direct
#     call without type-resolution. Walker emits the call with chain
#     ``[<name>]`` and adds ``INDIRECTION_FN_POINTER`` to the
#     indirection set. Resolver downstream can downweight matches.
#
#   * Macros that look like calls (``BUG_ON(...)``,
#     ``container_of(...)``) appear as ``call_expression`` to
#     tree-sitter — the preprocessor isn't run. The walker emits
#     them as regular calls with the macro identifier as chain.
#     Downstream consumers can disambiguate via the inventory's
#     macro list.
#
#   * No classes, no namespaces (C++ handles those separately).

INDIRECTION_FN_POINTER = "fn_pointer"  # C/C++ call through a fn pointer var

    :class:`FileCallGraph`.

    Returns an empty graph when ``tree_sitter_c`` isn't installed or
    the file is unparseable.

    Shapes captured:

      * ``#include "x.h"`` / ``#include <x.h>`` → ``imports``: the
        basename without extension maps to the full header path.
        ``#include "subdir/x.h"`` records both ``x`` → ``subdir/x.h``.
      * ``foo(...)`` → chain ``["foo"]``
      * ``obj.foo(...)`` → chain ``["obj", "foo"]``
        (struct field access via tree-sitter ``field_expression``)
      * ``obj->foo(...)`` → chain ``["obj", "foo"]``
        (pointer-to-struct field access; same node type)
      * ``a.b.c(...)`` / ``a->b->c(...)`` → chain ``["a", "b", "c"]``
      * ``(*fp)(...)`` → chain ``[<name>]`` + ``INDIRECTION_FN_POINTER``
      * ``fp(...)`` where ``fp`` looks like a local variable —
        statically indistinguishable from a direct call; emitted as a
        regular call. Downstream consumers wanting to filter
        function-pointer-likely callees should consult the inventory
        for whether ``fp`` is a known function name.

    Limitations (deliberate, not bugs):

      * Macros that expand to call expressions are not seen as such —
        the walker reads pre-preprocessor source. ``BUG_ON(x)`` is
        emitted as a call to ``BUG_ON``; its expansion (``do { if
        (x) { ... } } while (0)``) is invisible.
      * Typedef'd function-pointer types aren't traced; only the
        syntactic ``(*fp)(...)`` form is recognised as indirection.
      * K&R-style function definitions are accepted by tree-sitter
        but the declarator walk only handles ANSI prototypes for
        signature/parameters extraction.

        methods=[("bar", line), ...])`` in
        ``FileCallGraph.classes``.
      * ``int Foo::bar() {...}`` (out-of-line) → ``bar`` is pushed
        as the caller name (matches the C convention); calls inside
        bar's body tagged with ``receiver_class="Foo"``.
      * ``this->member()`` inside class body → chain ``["this",
        "member"]`` + ``receiver_class`` = enclosing class.
      * Bare ``member()`` inside class body → chain ``["member"]``;
        treated as implicit-this only when the name is in the
        current class's method list — otherwise emitted as a plain
        call.

    Out of scope at this revision:

      * Template instantiation. ``vector<int>`` callees emit the
        bare ``vector`` (the type-args are dropped). Method-template
        calls are emitted with the bare method name.
      * Operator overloading. ``a + b`` doesn't emit a call to
        ``operator+`` even though it resolves to one.
      * Implicit conversion / constructor calls. Only syntactic
        calls are emitted.
      * ``using namespace ns;`` doesn't fold ``ns::`` qualifiers off
        of subsequent calls.
