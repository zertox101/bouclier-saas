"""End-to-end integration tests for the binary-oracle arc.

These tests exercise the FULL path: build a real C project + binary,
run the enrich pipeline (auto-detect → classifier → chokepoint
accessor → reachability verdict → witness), and verify each layer
of the chain returns what downstream consumers expect.

Different from the unit tests, which mock the inventory + chokepoint
in isolation. These prove the layers compose correctly.
