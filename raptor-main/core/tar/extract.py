"""Streaming tar extraction with consumer-supplied member selection.

Two raptor consumers walk attacker-influenced tar archives and pull
selected members into memory:

  * :mod:`core.oci.blob` — layer tarballs from container registries.
    Streams from an HTTP response body. Selects by exact path
    membership in a wanted-paths set (e.g. ``var/lib/dpkg/status``).
    Layer member names are legitimately absolute, and entries are
    read into memory so on-disk traversal isn't a risk.

  * ``packages/sca/llm/version_diff_review`` — PyPI / RubyGems /
    Cargo / npm source archives. Reads from an in-memory ``bytes``
    blob (download is small enough to buffer). Selects by file
    extension allowlist (e.g. ``.py``, ``.js``, ``.md``). Strips the
    top-level directory prefix that source distributions wrap their
    contents in.

The two have the same shape — open archive, iterate members,
filter (safety + caller predicate), bound the read, normalise the
path, stash bytes in a dict — but historically each rolled its
own loop. That meant the safety check, size budget, and
streaming/buffered handling drifted. This module unifies them.

What's parameterised:

  * ``source`` — accepts either a chunk iterator (streaming) or
    a single ``bytes`` blob (buffered). Internally normalises to a
    file-like object the underlying ``tarfile`` reader can drive.
  * ``mode`` — passed through to ``tarfile.open``. Defaults to
    ``"r|gz"`` (streaming gzip, can't seek). SCA uses ``"r:*"``
    (auto-detect compression, supports seeking — needed because
    PyPI sdists can be gzip OR bzip2 OR xz).
  * ``selector`` — consumer callback returning the dict key for
    members to keep, or ``None`` to skip. The split (predicate +
    key generation in one call) lets the caller normalise the path
    however suits.
  * ``max_member_bytes`` — per-member size cap (defends against
    "package state file" the size of the whole archive).
  * ``allow_absolute_paths`` — passed through to
    :func:`safe_member_reason`. ``True`` for read-into-memory
    consumers (no escape risk applies).
  * ``expected_count`` — when set and reached, the iterator
    short-circuits without reading the rest of the archive. Saves
    streaming through hundreds of megabytes after the wanted
    paths have all been found.

Returns ``Dict[str, bytes]`` — consumers decode if they want
text. The byte-vs-text concern is the consumer's, not ours.

    ``selector(member)`` returns the dict key for members to keep,
    or ``None`` to skip. Members are first checked by
    :func:`safe_member_reason` — entries that fail safety are
    skipped before the selector even sees them.

    ``mode`` is passed straight to :func:`tarfile.open`. Stream
    modes (``"r|gz"``, ``"r|"``, etc.) work member-by-member without
    seeking — required when ``source`` is a chunk iterator. Random-
    access modes (``"r:*"``, ``"r:gz"``) can rewind but consume the
    whole stream into a temp file first.

    ``allow_absolute_paths`` defaults to ``False`` (the strict
    on-disk extraction default). Read-into-memory consumers (OCI
    layer extraction) can pass ``True`` because there's no on-disk
    path to escape from.

    ``expected_count`` short-circuits the walk once the result dict
    reaches that size. For consumers that know exactly how many
    files they're after (targeted extraction), this avoids
    streaming through the rest of a multi-hundred-MB archive.
