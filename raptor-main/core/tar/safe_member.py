"""Tar member safety predicate.

Wraps :func:`tarfile.data_filter` (PEP 706 / Python 3.12+) into a
boolean predicate consumers use as a skip-or-continue check.
Returns False for any disqualifying member; the caller decides
whether to skip-and-continue or abort the whole extraction.

The hardening rules (per PEP 706's ``data`` filter):

  * **Path traversal** — member name resolved against the
    extraction destination must not escape it. Catches
    ``../../../etc/passwd``, ``/etc/shadow``, and Windows-shaped
    drive letters that POSIX tar still accepts.
  * **Absolute paths** — leading ``/`` rejected; a tarball
    extracting to ``/usr/local`` shouldn't be writing to ``/etc``.
  * **Symlinks outside dest** — ``ln -s /etc/shadow shadow.lnk``
    in the tar would, on extract, write a symlink that the next
    open follows out of the sandbox. Refused.
  * **Hard links** — same shape as symlinks for the purposes of
    sandbox escape; refused.
  * **Special files** — block devices, character devices, FIFOs,
    sockets. None should ever appear in a "data" tarball.
  * **uid/gid bits** — setuid / setgid / sticky bits stripped.
    A tarball can't usefully grant SUID 0 to its own files; the
    presence is suspicious.

In addition to the PEP 706 rules, this helper enforces a per-member
size cap. PEP 706 doesn't address compression bombs (the size cap
is the consumer's responsibility); we fold it in here so consumers
get one predicate to call.

Usage:

    for member in tf:
        if not is_safe_member(member):
            continue
        # extract member safely
