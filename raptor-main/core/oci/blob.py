"""Streaming layer-blob inspection.

A layer is a gzipped tar archive (~100 MB compressed common,
several GB rare-but-real). For SBOM extraction we only need a few
specific files (``var/lib/dpkg/status``, ``lib/apk/db/installed``,
``var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite``). Streaming the gzipped bytes through
a tar reader and pulling just those entries — instead of pulling
the whole blob into memory or to disk — is what makes this
tolerable.

The actual tar walking (open in stream mode, iterate members,
apply the safety filter, stash the bytes) lives in
:func:`core.tar.extract_files_from_tar`. This module supplies the
OCI-specific bits: path normalisation (``./`` and leading ``/``
stripped) and a wanted-paths-set membership selector. Layer
member names are legitimately absolute (``/var/lib/dpkg/status``
appears as ``var/lib/dpkg/status`` after normalisation), and the
consumer reads into memory rather than to disk, so
``allow_absolute_paths=True`` is correct here.

    e.g. ``{"var/lib/dpkg/status", "lib/apk/db/installed"}``. Paths
    are matched against the tar entry name with leading ``./`` and
    leading ``/`` normalised away (different image build pipelines

    not present in this layer are simply absent from the result —
    the caller stitches together multi-layer state by overlaying
    later layers on earlier ones (later wins, per Docker's
    overlay-fs semantics).
