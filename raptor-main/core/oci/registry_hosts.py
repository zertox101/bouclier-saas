"""Resolve a list of HTTPS hosts the sandbox must allow for a given
image reference's registry to work.

The sandbox's egress proxy takes a static allowlist
(``proxy_hosts=[...]``) at run time. For OCI work, the host(s) we
need depend on the image's registry, and some registries (notably
Docker Hub) split into multiple hosts: ``registry-1.docker.io``
serves manifests + blobs but ``auth.docker.io`` issues bearer tokens.

This resolver knows the well-known mappings. Project-internal /
self-hosted registries pass through as-is (``my-registry.corp.example``
just allows itself).

Adding a new registry family: extend ``_REGISTRY_FAMILIES`` with a
predicate + list of hosts. Tests should add coverage for the
predicate edge cases.
