class HackerProgressBar:
    """Multi-stage progress display for SCA-shaped pipelines.

    Each stage gets a single self-rewriting line (cleared + reprinted
    on each tick) showing the active stage name, an optional progress
    bar, and a counter. When the stage completes, the line is
    rewritten one final time to the stage's summary form and a
    newline locks it in scrollback. The next ``stage()`` call begins
    a fresh self-rewriting line below.

    Finding-flash callouts (``flash()``) interleave: the active line
    is cleared, the flash line is printed and locked, then the
    active line is re-rendered below. The flash sticks in scrollback;
    the active line continues advancing.

    TTY-only by default (``disabled`` auto-set when stderr isn't a
    TTY). Non-TTY path emits one start-line and one done-line per
    stage with no redraws — friendly to pipes / CI logs / file
    redirects.

    Single-stage pipelines should use ``HackerProgress`` (above) —
    that's the simpler operations >15s case. ``HackerProgressBar``
    is for pipelines with N discrete phases the operator wants
    to see resolve one by one.

    Side-channel last-stage tracking
    -------------------------------
    On every ``stage()`` call the bar updates a module-level
    ``_LAST_STAGE_NAME`` so out-of-band exception handlers can
    surface "which phase was running when this died" without
    threading the bar through every call site. The CLI's outer
    ``except`` reads it via :func:`last_stage_name` to print
    "raptor-sca: unrecoverable error during osv (...)" instead
    of the opaque pre-fix "unrecoverable error during run".

    The variable persists past ``done()`` / ``end()`` so the
    handler still has context if the failure occurred between
    stages (e.g. during an artefact write that isn't itself a
    stage).
