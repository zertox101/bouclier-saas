    (standalone mode). Only ``-`` and ``_`` are accepted to avoid
    strftime-directive injection (e.g., a caller passing ``%H`` would
    get the format string interpreted).

    Collision-prevention layers:

      1. Wall-clock second — gives chronological ordering.
      2. PID — disambiguates concurrent processes (cross-process).
      3. ``monotonic_ns() % 10_000`` 4-digit tail — disambiguates
         same-process calls within the same wall-clock second.

    Pre-fix the suffix was just `<timestamp>_pid<PID>`. The docstring
    noted "single process calling this multiple times within the same
    second would reuse its PID — not a concern for the lifecycle
    entry-point use case (one call per run start)" but that
    assumption is fragile: test harnesses iterating `start_run`,
    batch tooling, supervisor loops invoking subcommands serially,
    and any future caller that re-enters the lifecycle within a
    second all hit the in-process collision. Concrete consequences
    depend on the caller — `mkdir(exist_ok=True)` silently shares
    the dir (interleaved writes), `mkdir(exist_ok=False)` raises,
    downstream code may overwrite per-run files. The 4-digit
    monotonic tail closes that window without changing the
    user-visible name shape meaningfully (one extra suffix).
