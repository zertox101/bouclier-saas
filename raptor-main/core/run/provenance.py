"""Run provenance — point-in-time facts sealed into .raptor-run.json.

The manifest answers "what produced this run" and must be captured WHEN
the run executes, never reconstructed afterwards. Today's git SHA, today's
models.json, and today's tool versions have nothing to do with the run that
found a bug weeks ago — citing them later would be a fabrication. So
`start_run` seals the source-control + environment snapshot before analysis
touches anything, and `complete_run` merges in what is only knowable at the
end (the models that actually fired, engine versions).

Every value here is best-effort: a fact that cannot be determined is recorded
as ``None``, never as a fabricated or "today" placeholder. A consumer reading
``base_sha is None`` knows the provenance was unavailable; it must not infer
the current HEAD.

# /project rollup, a future citation view) go through THESE rather than indexing
# the raw ``.raptor-run.json`` dict, so the manifest's internal shape can evolve
# without breaking them. Every accessor takes the loaded run-metadata dict (from
# ``load_run_metadata(run_dir)``) and degrades gracefully — missing/legacy
# fields return None / empty, never raise — so the same call works against an
# old manifest, today's, and one with fields not yet added.
#
# The companion location convention is ``RUN_METADATA_FILE`` +
# ``load_run_metadata(run_dir)`` in core.run.metadata.
