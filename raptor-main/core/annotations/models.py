class Annotation:
    """One function's annotation.

    ``file``: source file path. Stored exactly as supplied; callers
    use repo-relative paths consistently so the resulting markdown
    layout mirrors the source tree.

    ``function``: function identifier. Top-level functions: bare
    name (``foo``). Class methods: dotted (``Klass.method``).
    Operators / mangled names: caller's responsibility to choose
    a stable string.

    ``body``: free-form markdown prose. May be empty (a clean-status
    annotation can carry just metadata). The body is preserved
    verbatim across read-write round-trips.

    ``metadata``: structured key=value pairs from the HTML-comment
    frontmatter (``<!-- meta: status=clean cwe=CWE-78 -->``).
    Conventional keys:
      * ``status``: ``clean`` / ``suspicious`` / ``finding`` /
        ``error`` (matches the audit coverage status enum)
      * ``cwe``: e.g. ``CWE-78``
      * ``source``: ``human`` / ``llm`` — who wrote the annotation.
        ``write_annotation(..., overwrite="respect-manual")`` skips
        writes whose existing record has ``source=human`` so LLM
        passes never clobber operator notes. Operator-driven CLI
        commands set ``source=human``; LLM-driven callers set
        ``source=llm``.
      * ``hash``: short sha256 prefix of the function's source lines,
        captured at annotation time so callers can detect a stale
        annotation when the source edits later. Use
        ``core.annotations.compute_function_hash`` to populate.

    Other keys are accepted; readers tolerate unknown keys to allow
    consumer-specific extensions without schema migrations.
