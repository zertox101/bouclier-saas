"""Tests for cross-process locking on annotation writes.

Without the lock, two concurrent writers can lose each other's
data via the read-modify-write race: both load state A, both write
A+B1 / A+B2, one of B1/B2 is dropped. The lock serialises them.

These tests fork real subprocesses (not threads) — fcntl.flock is
process-level, and POSIX semantics are what we actually rely on.
