    a usable instance. Two surprises that fell out of that:

      * ``cfg = RaptorConfig(); cfg.SOMETHING = 42`` set the
        attribute on the INSTANCE, while every internal site
        reads `RaptorConfig.SOMETHING` (the class attribute) —
        so the override silently no-ops with no error. Operators
        debugging a "my override isn't taking effect" issue had
        no signal that the override sites were reading past the
        instance.
      * Test fixtures that did ``cfg = RaptorConfig()`` to scope
        a `patch.object(cfg, "X", ...)` similarly mutated the
        instance, leaving production code unaffected.

    Block instantiation explicitly so the misuse fails fast at
    the call site instead of producing a phantom instance.

             through unless we explicitly add them.
          2. Blocklist (DANGEROUS_ENV_VARS + PROXY_ENV_VARS) — overlay.
             Belt + braces against an accidentally-over-broad allowlist
             prefix. By default also strips proxy vars (HTTP_PROXY,
             HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) — most subprocesses (codeql build,
             fuzzing harness, gdb) shouldn't be making outbound HTTP
             on the operator's behalf, and a proxy that was set for
             interactive use can leak through.

        ``preserve_proxy=True`` keeps the proxy vars in the returned
        env. Use only for subprocesses that legitimately need to
        proxy outbound HTTP — typically the egress wrapper, the
        sandbox proxy itself, or LLM clients that need to honour
        an operator's HTTPS_PROXY setting. The dangerous-env-var
        strip still applies.

        ``include_python_user_base=True`` (F102) re-admits the
        ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` variable from the original os.environ
        AFTER the dangerous-env-vars strip. Use only at scanner
        invocation sites that legitimately depend on a
        ``pip install --user`` tool (e.g. semgrep). The variable is
        a real RCE vector via .pth files (see DANGEROUS_ENV_VARS
        comment at PYTHONUSERBASE) and stays stripped by default;
        but if the operator deliberately installed the scanner under
        ``~/.local`` with a non-default ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` set, the
        subprocess fails ``ModuleNotFoundError`` without this opt-in.
        Mirrors the ``preserve_proxy`` opt-in pattern.

        Callers who need a specific extra var (JAVA_HOME for a Java tool,
        a custom CA bundle, etc.) should add it to the returned dict
        explicitly after calling get_safe_env(), or pass their own env=
        to subprocess.run() to bypass this filter entirely.
