"""SHA-256 hashing — single chokepoint for the codebase.

Four closed-form primitives:
  - sha256_tree(root, ...)  whole directory (filenames + contents)
  - sha256_file(path, ...)  single file, streamed in chunks
  - sha256_bytes(data)      bytes already in memory
  - sha256_string(s)        one-shot string hash

Every string-to-bytes conversion uses ``errors="surrogateescape"`` so
non-UTF-8 filenames (common on Linux) hash safely instead of raising
``UnicodeEncodeError``. For valid UTF-8 the encoding is identical.

For iterative accumulation across many inputs, use ``hashlib.sha256()``
directly — that's the right primitive and core.hash deliberately
doesn't wrap it.

    #
    # Two leaks:
    #
    #   1. STAT-THEN-OPEN TOCTOU. Between p.stat() and
    #      p.open(), the file could grow (a concurrent writer
    #      under the target dir, or an attacker exploiting the
    #      window). The size check then fired on the OLD size
    #      while the open read reflected the NEW size, so a
    #      file the gate "skipped" actually had its full
    #      post-grow contents fed into the hash on the
    #      subsequent read.
    #   2. NO CUMULATIVE CAP. Each file's per-file size was
    #      bounded but the AGGREGATE bytes-hashed across the
    #      whole tree was unbounded. A target with 10K files of
    #      99% of max_file_size each consumed N×bound bytes of
    #      read I/O. Hashing-a-target-tree workflows on the
    #      sandbox path would hit the timeout, with no signal
    #      about which directory was responsible.
    #
    # Fix:
    #   * Open with O_NOFOLLOW (already won't follow symlinks
    #     because we filtered above; defence in depth).
    #   * fstat the OPEN FD — same kernel inode, no TOCTOU.
    #   * Track cumulative bytes hashed; abort with a logged
    #     warning when the cap is hit (default: 100x
    #     max_file_size — operators can set MAX_TREE_HASH_BYTES
    #     in config to override).
