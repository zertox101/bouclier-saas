"""HTTP client interface — single chokepoint for outbound HTTP from RAPTOR.

Two backends ship today:

  - :class:`~core.http.urllib_backend.UrllibClient` — urllib3-backed
    with connection pooling, bounded size, gzip-decompress, and
    exponential backoff. No host allowlist; reaches anywhere. Use
    only where the egress proxy isn't appropriate (tests, dev paths
    without sandbox).

  - :class:`~core.http.egress_backend.EgressClient` — routes via the
    in-process HTTPS proxy at ``core.sandbox.proxy``. Hostname
    allowlist enforced by the proxy; refuses CONNECT to anything
    outside the registered hosts. Use this for any production HTTP
    call where the threat model includes "compromised parser
    exfiltrates to attacker host".

Callers depend on the :class:`HttpClient` Protocol only — concrete
backend swap is one factory call, no consumer churn.

Constants below are defaults. Callers may override per-call timeouts
and per-call max_bytes; the user-agent is fixed at client construction
(``UrllibClient(user_agent=...)``) but not per-call.

    Returned by the low-level :meth:`HttpClient.request` and used

    depend on urllib3 types directly.

    Use the convenience methods (``get_json``, ``post_json``,
    ``get_bytes``) when you only need the body. Drop down to
    ``request()`` when you need response headers — typical case is
    capturing ``ETag`` / ``Last-Modified`` for a subsequent
    conditional request via ``If-None-Match`` / ``If-Modified-Since``.

    Header keys are **lowercased on storage** so callers can do
    ``resp.headers["etag"]`` regardless of how the server cased it.
    Servers send mixed case (``ETag``, ``Etag``, ``etag``); the
    HTTP spec says headers are case-insensitive, and forcing one
    casing keeps caller code simple.

    ``url`` is the final URL after any redirects (or the request URL
    if redirects were disabled / the backend couldn't determine the
