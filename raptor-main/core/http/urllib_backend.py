"""urllib3-backed implementation of :class:`core.http.HttpClient`.

Why urllib3 not stdlib urllib:
  - **Connection pooling.** urllib3 reuses TCP+TLS connections across
    requests to the same host. SCA-shaped workloads (~100 calls across
    ~5 hosts) see ~4× speedup on the HTTP layer because handshakes
    amortise.
  - **No surprise no_proxy bypass.** stdlib urllib's ``ProxyHandler``
    silently honours ``no_proxy`` env vars and skips the proxy for
    matching hosts; verified empirically that ``no_proxy=*`` lets a
    request connect direct, defeating EgressClient's chokepoint.
    urllib3's ``ProxyManager`` does NOT read env vars at request
    time — every request goes through the configured proxy, full
    stop. One fewer security-critical workaround to maintain.
  - **Consistent TLS via certifi.** Stdlib urllib's CA store varies
    across distros / containers / OSes. urllib3 ships its own
    bundle and is configured CERT_REQUIRED + hostname-verified by
    default in 2.x.

Honours Retry-After on 429/503; exponential backoff on other transient
errors; bounded total retry duration; size caps on responses; gzip
decompression of responses that arrive compressed even when not
requested (some servers do this).

No allowlist — UrllibClient can reach any host on :443. For
allowlisted egress, use :class:`core.http.egress_backend.EgressClient`.

    After ``threshold`` 429/5xx events from the same host within

    retrying through the full backoff schedule (1+2+5+15+60+300 =
    383s per request).

    Why this exists: anonymous Docker Hub pulls hit a hard rate
    limit (100 / 6h per IP) that no amount of in-process backoff
    can recover from. With 8 worker threads each retrying every
    rate-limited fetch through the full schedule, a multi-image
    project (istio: 87 unique image refs) can spend 5-7 minutes
    burning sleep cycles for fetches that are guaranteed to fail.
    The circuit breaker bounds that to ``cooldown`` seconds total
    instead of ``unique_failed_fetches × 383s``.

    Successful responses to the host clear both the failure
    history and the open-state, so a host that recovers (e.g.
    rate-limit window resets) is immediately tried again.

    Thread-safe: SCA's OCI fetcher uses an 8-worker ThreadPool

        """GET ``url``, yield response body chunks without buffering.

        Use for large downloads (multi-100MB+) where ``get_bytes`` would
        balloon RSS. Cumulative size cap is enforced across yielded
        chunks; exceeding ``max_bytes`` raises :class:`SizeLimitExceeded`
        mid-stream.

        ``timeout`` caps the per-attempt connect+read window. The
        ``total_timeout`` parameter is accepted for **API symmetry**
        with the buffered methods but only enforced on connection
        setup — once the iterator yields its first chunk, the body
        read is bounded by ``timeout`` alone (urllib3 has no clean
        knob for "wall-clock cap on streamed reads").

        ``retries`` is accepted for API symmetry but **must be 0** —
        mid-stream failures aren't transparently retryable (would
        need range-resumed restart). Non-zero values raise
        :class:`ValueError`. Caller can wrap the iterator in their
        own retry loop if needed.

        Caller must fully consume the iterator OR call ``.close()`` on
        it to release the connection back to the pool.

        A common pattern (NOTE the explicit ``max_bytes``)::

            with open(dest, "wb") as f:
                for chunk in client.stream_bytes(url, max_bytes=100 * 1024 * 1024):
                    f.write(chunk)

        Always pass an explicit ``max_bytes`` ceiling. Pre-fix
        the example here omitted ``max_bytes``, leading
        callers to hit the method's default and write
        attacker-served content straight to disk. Even a
        modest 1 GB serve from a hostile mirror can fill a
        constrained ``/tmp`` partition before the operator
        notices. ``max_bytes`` enforces the cap by raising
        :class:`SizeLimitExceeded` mid-stream — your
        ``with open(...)`` block then sees the partial-write
        file, which the caller should ``os.unlink`` in the
        except handler.

        """Parse Retry-After header. Both delta-seconds and HTTP-date forms.

        RFC 7231 §7.1.3 defines two grammars: a non-negative integer
        (``Retry-After: 120``) or an HTTP-date
        (``Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT``). Pre-fix the
        seconds-only path silently returned None on the date form,
        which caused the caller's retry loop to fall back to its
        default backoff schedule — typically much shorter than what
        the upstream actually wanted. For a 503 from Cloudflare /
        Akamai (commonly date-form), this triggered the retry storm
        the header is supposed to prevent.

        Both forms get clamped to [1, 1800] so a malicious /
        misconfigured upstream can't tie up our connection slot for
        an arbitrary delay. Negative deltas (legacy behaviour bug)
        and past dates both clamp to 1.
