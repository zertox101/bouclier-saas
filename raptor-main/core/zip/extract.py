"""Zip extraction with consumer-supplied member selection.

Several raptor consumers walk attacker-influenced zip archives:

  * ``packages/sca/llm/version_diff_review`` — PyPI / RubyGems /
    Cargo / npm source archives in zip form (some PyPI sdists
    ship as ``.zip`` rather than ``.tar.gz``). Reads from in-
    memory ``bytes``, selects by file extension allowlist.

  * ``packages/sca/python_modules`` — PyPI wheel inspection
    (looking for ``*.dist-info/top_level.txt`` to learn what
    module name a distribution installs as). Targeted single-
    file read; doesn't fit the streaming-walk shape and stays
    direct.

  * ``packages/codeql/database_manager`` — extract a CodeQL
    database archive into a destination directory.

  * Future SCA wheel-platform scanner — open wheels and
    inspect ``*.dist-info/METADATA`` + ``WHEEL`` tags.

These share the shape — open archive, iterate members, filter
(safety + caller predicate), bound the read, normalise the path,
stash bytes in a dict — exactly the same shape
:mod:`core.tar.extract_files_from_tar` consolidated for tar.
This module mirrors it for zip.

What's parameterised:

  * ``source`` — accepts either a ``bytes`` blob or a path-like
    object (zipfile requires a seekable backend, so streaming
    chunk-iterators are not supported the way they are for tar).
  * ``selector`` — consumer callback returning the dict key for
    members to keep, or ``None`` to skip.
  * ``max_member_bytes`` — per-member size cap.
  * ``max_ratio`` — per-member compression-ratio cap (zip-
    specific bomb defense).
  * ``allow_absolute_paths`` — passed through to
    :func:`safe_member_reason`.
  * ``expected_count`` — short-circuit when reached.

Returns ``Dict[str, bytes]`` — consumers decode if they want
text. Decoding policy stays with the consumer.

    """Walk ``source`` (a zip archive) and return selected members
    as a ``{key: bytes}`` dict.

    ``selector(info)`` returns the dict key for members to keep,
    or ``None`` to skip. Members are first checked by
    :func:`safe_member_reason` — entries that fail safety are
    skipped before the selector even sees them.

    Zip requires a seekable backend, so ``source`` is either a
    ``bytes`` blob, a filesystem path, or a seekable file-like
    object. Streaming iterators (tar's "chunk-iterator" shape)
    aren't supported — zip's central directory lives at the end
    of the archive, so you can't usefully parse one without
    seeking. Consumers that have a stream should buffer it first.

    ``allow_absolute_paths`` defaults to ``False`` (strict on-
    disk extraction default). Read-into-memory consumers
    inspecting absolute-path-bearing archives can pass ``True``.

    ``expected_count`` short-circuits the walk once the result
    dict reaches that size. For consumers that know exactly how
    many files they're after, this avoids reading the rest of a
    multi-hundred-MB archive.

    ``max_entry_count`` defends against zip-bomb-shaped archives
    with millions of entries that would blow up
    ``zipfile.ZipFile.__init__``'s central-directory read. When
    ``source`` is a path or bytes blob (i.e. the EOCD record can
    be located), we read it BEFORE opening the archive and reject
    over-cap declarations early. Defence-in-depth: we also stop
    iterating if the in-memory ``infolist()`` exceeds the cap.
    Default ``DEFAULT_MAX_ENTRIES`` (10 000) is generous for every
    real consumer; set to a very large number to disable.

    ``raise_on_entry_count``: by default an over-cap archive is
    treated as "couldn't read" — returns ``{}`` like any other
    parse failure. Consumers that want to surface the rejection
    explicitly (project import, CodeQL DB unpack) pass ``True``
    to get :class:`ZipEntryCountExceeded`.
