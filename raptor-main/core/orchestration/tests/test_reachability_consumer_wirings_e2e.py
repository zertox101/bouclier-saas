"""End-to-end test for reachability consumer wirings.

Exercises the full integration: a synthetic project tree, the
/agentic prepass building an inventory, then all three consumers
(codeql / /validate / /agentic enrichment) acting on the SAME
inventory + checklist data without rebuilds.

Pure-Python — no LLM calls, no real scanner subprocess. The
expensive scanner stages are mocked; the reachability decisions
that drive consumer behaviour are real.

Architecture exercised:

  1. Project tree: ``src/live.py`` (function called from main),
     ``src/dead.py`` (function never called), ``src/main.py``
     (entry).
  2. ``run_reachability_prepass`` builds inventory, marks the
     dead function priority=low in the checklist on disk.
  3. Codeql analyzer constructed with ``reachability_inventory=``
     pointing at the prepass's inventory. Analyzer's
     ``_check_reachability`` returns "not_called" for findings
     in the dead function and "reachable" for findings in the live
     one (it has an entry→sink path from main) — WITHOUT rebuilding
     the inventory. ``not_called`` is a
     HEURISTIC verdict: it is surfaced but NO LONGER hard-skips
     the expensive analysis (only SOUND witnesses — module_aborts
     / lexical_dead — do; that wiring lives in the codeql
     prefilter test).
  4. /validate's ``demote_unreachable_paths`` invoked with the
     SAME inventory (via ``inventory=`` kwarg). Attack paths
     anchored to dead-code findings get proximity clamped and
     blockers appended.
  5. The /agentic checklist's priority markers are visible in
     the on-disk JSON (the agentic LLM analysis prompt would
     read these).

Verifies:

  * Prepass builds + persists priority markers to checklist.
  * In-process inventory sharing actually works (no rebuilds in
    sibling consumers when DI'd).
  * Codeql surfaces the not_called verdict but (U11) does NOT
    hard-skip on it — the finding proceeds past the reachability
    skip gate into the full analysis.
  * /validate demotes the right paths.
  * All three consumers' verdicts are CONSISTENT for the same
    function (synthetic project shape verifies the resolver's
    qualified-name construction matches).
