"""Bridge between /understand output and /validate input.
This is the start of the full automation vision where our idea is that an analyst can run /understand to get a head start on mapping the 
attack surface and then seamlessly pick up that context in /validate without manual exports or imports.

Handles three things automatically so the analyst doesn't have to:

  1. Populate attack-surface.json from context-map.json, the schemas share the
     same required keys (sources/sinks/trust_boundaries), so this is a selective
     copy plus merge when the file already exists.

  2. Import flow-trace-*.json into attack-paths.json — steps[], proximity, and
     blockers[] are shared schema between trace and attack-paths, so traces slot
     straight in as starting paths for Stage B.

  3. Enrich checklist.json with priority markers, functions that appear as entry
     points or sinks in the context map are tagged high-priority so Stage B attacks
     the most important code first rather than working through a flat list.

Usage (from Stage 0 in /validate):

    from core.orchestration.understand_bridge import find_understand_output, load_understand_context, enrich_checklist

    understand_dir, stale_files = find_understand_output(validate_dir, target_path=target)
    if understand_dir:
        bridge = load_understand_context(understand_dir, validate_dir, stale_files)
        if bridge["context_map_loaded"]:
            enrich_checklist(checklist, bridge["context_map"], str(validate_dir))

The three-tier search in find_understand_output() covers:
  1. Shared --out directory (context-map.json co-located)
  2. Project sibling directories (same project, different run)
  3. Global out/ scan (match by checklist target_path — no project needed)

    Three-tier search eliminates the need for --out alignment:

    2. **Project siblings**: sibling run dirs in the same project
    3. **Global out/**: scan out/ for understand runs matching the same target_path

    When multiple candidates exist across tiers 2+3, they are ranked by
    hash freshness first (files unchanged since understand ran) then by
    modification time. A stale candidate is only selected if no fresh one
    exists.

    Freshness is determined by hashing current files on disk and comparing
    against the understand run's checklist — not against the validate
    checklist, which may share a symlinked file in project mode.

    Mutates ``context_map`` in place; returns it for chaining. Does six
    deterministic passes that are safe to run multiple times (idempotent):

    1. **Path normalisation** on every ``file:`` field across entry_points,
       sink_details, boundary_details. Strips leading ``./``; converts
       absolute paths under ``target_path`` to relative-from-target. The
       bridge's downstream strict-equality match is sensitive to this.

    2. **Name backfill** on entry_points and sink_details: when the LLM
       emitted ``file`` + ``line`` but no ``name``, look up the function
       in the checklist whose line range contains that line and inject
       the function's name. Enables function-level enrichment instead of
       falling back to file-level (which over-marks unrelated helpers).

    3. **File-existence validation**: warns when a context-map entry
       references a file that doesn't appear in the checklist (LLM
       hallucination).

    4. **Line-in-file sanity**: warns when a referenced line exceeds the
       file's known length.

    5. **Cross-reference validation**: warns when ``unchecked_flows``
       references entry_point or sink IDs that don't exist in the
       respective lists.

    6. **Library-surface augmentation** (``_augment_library_surface``): the
       first consumer of ``checklist['target_kind']``. For a library/hybrid
       target, stamps the kind, records the public API as a trust boundary +
       attacker-controlled source, and backfills the exported functions as
       entry points the LLM missed. No-op for application/unknown.

    For a ``library``/``hybrid`` target the public/exported API *is* the attack
    surface: a consumer passes attacker-controlled data into the exported
    functions, so their parameters are untrusted sources. The LLM, looking for
    HTTP routes / a ``main``, often reports a pure library as having "no entry
    points"; this pass closes that gap deterministically from the inventory.

    Three additions (idempotent — safe to re-run, tagged with stable
    ``origin`` markers so a second pass adds nothing):
      1. Stamp ``context_map['target_kind']`` (+ reason) for any kind.
      2. A single ``library-api`` trust-boundary record and a matching
         attacker-controlled ``sources`` record.
      3. Backfill *every* exported function as an entry point (no cap —
         truncating attack surface is a false negative, and reachability
         already treats all exports as entries), deduped against entries the
         LLM already enumerated.
