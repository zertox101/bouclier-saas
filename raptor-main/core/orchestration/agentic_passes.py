"""Pre-scan and post-scan enrichment passes for /agentic.

When the user passes ``--understand`` or ``--validate``, these functions
dispatch ``claude -p`` subprocesses with the relevant skill loaded. Both
passes are first-class run dirs created via libexec/raptor-run-lifecycle,
so the resulting artefacts are project-aware and discoverable by the
existing /understand → /validate bridge:

  --understand: creates a proper command_type=understand run dir as a
                sibling of the agentic run dir (project sibling in
                project mode, global out/ otherwise). Builds checklist,
                runs the /understand --map workflow via claude -p, and
                produces context-map.json. The artefact is reusable by
                later /validate runs against the same target via the
                bridge tier-2/3 lookup.

  --validate:   creates a proper command_type=validate run dir as a
                sibling of the agentic run dir. Selects findings with
                is_exploitable == True or confidence == "high",
                persists them to a file (defending against finding_id
                prompt injection), then runs the /validate skill via
                claude -p. The bridge tier-2 lookup finds the
                understand sibling automatically — no copying.

Both passes degrade gracefully:
  - claude not on PATH      -> skipped, base pipeline still runs
  - block_cc_dispatch=True  -> skipped (untrusted target repo)
  - lifecycle start fails   -> skipped, no orphan dir
  - subprocess fails        -> lifecycle marked failed, base pipeline continues

The return value carries a ``skipped`` reason so the main flow can log it.
Functions never raise — a backstop catches unexpected exceptions and turns
them into ran=False.
