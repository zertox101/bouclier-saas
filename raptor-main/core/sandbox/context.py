    Called when ``audit_mode`` was requested but ``spawn_eligible`` is
    False, to populate the operator-facing WARNING and the
    ``sandbox-audit-degraded.json`` marker.

    Resolution order — the first matching cause wins, so check the
    most specific causes first:

      1. B fallback / cache hit set ``b_fallback_reason`` upstream
         (cmd[0] outside mount tree, or cached as known-failing).
         Their reason is the most specific: it names the binary.
      2. ``check_mount_available()`` False — host kernel refuses
         unprivileged mount-ns (Ubuntu 24.04 default sysctl).
      3. ``pass_fds=`` kwarg set — _spawn doesn't plumb inherited
         fds; the call had to go subprocess+preexec.
      4. ``input=`` kwarg set — same reason; piping stdin via
         input= can't survive mount-ns fork+exec.
      5. ``target`` and ``output`` both None — mount-ns has nothing
         to bind-mount as the working area; the tracer has nowhere
         to attach in the new namespace.
      6. Catch-all — reachable only if a future change adds a new
         spawn-eligibility gate without updating this helper.

    Each branch returns a short ``reason`` (what failed) and
    ``instructions`` (operator action to fix). Both flow into the
    WARNING and the per-output-dir marker so audit operators can
    diagnose without cross-referencing source.

    Safe-open machinery (O_NOFOLLOW + O_NONBLOCK + ``fstat`` regular-
    file check, plus the target-pollution skip) is shared between
    two callers in this module:

      * Per-spawn write inside ``_run()`` — fires after each
        sandboxed subprocess completes, capturing that spawn's
        proxy-event slice as soon as the spawn returns.
      * Block-level write inside ``sandbox()`` ``__exit__`` —
        captures events recorded against the block token (i.e.,
        from non-subprocess HTTPClient calls inside the with-
        block, such as ``agent.py`` running ``analyse()`` in-
        process). Caller pre-dedups against per-spawn events so a
        single ``proxy-events.jsonl`` doesn't carry duplicates of
        what the per-spawn writes already persisted.

    No-op when:
      * ``events`` is empty (no payload to write).
      * ``output`` is ``None`` (no persistence target configured).
      * ``output`` resolves inside ``target`` (target-pollution
        skip — some callers pass ``output=target`` for writable
        Landlock surface; persisting the JSONL there would
        pollute the scanned tree).

    Non-fatal on every write failure. Observability is nice-to-

    surfaces in a DEBUG log line so operators investigating
    missing audit data can find the cause.

    """Context manager for sandboxed subprocess execution.

    Each run() call inside the context runs the target command with the
    isolation configured here. When `block_network=True` or mount
    isolation is active, each run() launches its subprocess inside a
    fresh user namespace via `unshare`; Landlock-only runs do NOT use
    namespaces and execute in the calling process's namespace (Landlock
    is applied in the child via preexec_fn). Resource rlimits always
    apply.

    Args:
        block_network: If True, block all network access via user namespace
                      (`unshare --user --net`). Overridden by profile=
                      and by --sandbox/--no-sandbox CLI flags.
        target: Path to target repo. Engages Landlock. Under Landlock, the
               path is an engagement marker only (Landlock does not restrict
               reads); under mount-namespace mode, it is bind-mounted read-
               only at /target inside the namespace.
        output: Path to output dir (always writable inside the sandbox).
               Engages Landlock and — when mount is active — bind-mounted
               at /output.
        map_root: Map current UID to root inside namespace (needed by some
                 builds that check `getuid() == 0`).
        limits: Resource limit overrides (memory_mb, max_file_mb, cpu_seconds).
        allowed_tcp_ports: If set, Landlock restricts TCP connect() to these
                          ports only (e.g. [443] for HTTPS API access).
                          Requires ABI v4 (kernel 6.7+); earlier kernels
                          emit a WARNING. Engages Landlock.

                          Landlock's network rule covers ONLY TCP connect().
                          UDP, raw sockets, and inbound TCP are NOT
                          restricted by this parameter — set
                          `block_network=True` for a hard network-off
                          policy (but then allowed_tcp_ports is useless
                          because the namespace removes all interfaces;
                          mixing the two produces a warning).
        profile: Named profile ('full', 'network-only', 'none'). Forces
                block_network to the profile's value AND — when the profile
                disables Landlock — nulls `target`, `output`, and
                `allowed_tcp_ports` (with a WARNING log if any were set).
                Unknown profile strings raise ValueError. Use --sandbox
                <profile> on the command line.
        disabled: Shortcut for `profile='none'`. All isolation off; only
                 rlimits apply. Kept as a separate param because its call
                 sites in code are easier to audit than an opaque profile
                 string.
        use_egress_proxy: If True, route the child's outbound HTTPS
                 traffic through a local HTTPS-CONNECT proxy with a
                 hostname allowlist. Closes the UDP/DNS exfil gap that
                 `allowed_tcp_ports` leaves open: seccomp blocks
                 AF_INET/AF_INET6 SOCK_DGRAM (so the child can't do DNS
                 directly), and `allowed_tcp_ports` is auto-set to the
                 proxy's ephemeral loopback port. The child env is
                 extended with HTTPS_PROXY/http_proxy (both cases, for
                 Node/curl/Python AND CodeQL's Java stack). Pair with
                 `proxy_hosts=[...]` to declare the hostname allowlist.
                 Implicitly sets block_network=False (network-ns block
                 would make the proxy unreachable).
        proxy_hosts: Hostname allowlist for the egress proxy. Union'd
                 with any existing allowlist if the proxy singleton is
                 already running. Required when use_egress_proxy=True.
        restrict_reads: If True, flip Landlock's default "read everywhere"
                 to "read only in allowed paths". Defaults to a system-
                 dirs allowlist that covers what normal compiled binaries
                 need (libc, ld.so, /proc, /dev, target, output, /tmp)
                 but excludes $HOME — so a sandboxed attacker binary
                 can't read ~/.ssh, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.config/raptor/
                 models.json. Extend with `readable_paths=[...]` if the
                 tool needs more.
        readable_paths: Extra read-allowed paths (adds to the default
                 system-dirs list when restrict_reads=True). Ignored
                 when restrict_reads=False (reads are already wide).
        caller_label: Optional short identifier (e.g. "claude-sub-agent",
                 "codeql-pack-download") that propagates into proxy
                 event records. Used for per-caller filtering of
                 sandbox_info["proxy_events"] when multiple callers
                 share the proxy singleton.
        fake_home: If True, the child's HOME and XDG_*_HOME env vars
                 are overridden to point at `{output}/.home/` — an
                 empty directory created for this sandbox. Tools see a
                 fresh, credential-free home: `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws/...`,
                 `~/.config/gh/...` etc. are absent (not just EACCES
                 via Landlock — they don't exist). Complements
                 `restrict_reads=True` by converting the HOME-denial
                 from "Landlock blocks reads" into "there's nothing
                 there to read". Callers that need specific files
                 available in the fake HOME (e.g. an API-key config)
                 should pre-populate `{output}/.home/` before invoking.

    filesystem restriction (via `target`/`output`), resource rlimits. At
    least one of `target` or `output` must be truthy so Landlock actually
    engages — empty strings are rejected.

    Network block cannot be disabled here. `allowed_tcp_ports` is
    intentionally not accepted: this function forces `block_network=True`
    at the namespace level, which removes all network interfaces inside
    the sandbox — so any Landlock TCP allow-rule would be inert. Callers
    wanting a network allowlist (e.g. Claude sub-agents on port 443) must
    use `sandbox()` directly with `block_network=False` and their own
    `allowed_tcp_ports=[...]`.

    `restrict_reads` defaults to True for run_untrusted() — the premise
    is "we're running attacker-derived code, protect the invoking user's
    credentials". With restrict_reads=True, reads are limited to system
    dirs (/usr, /lib, /etc, /proc, /sys), target, output, /tmp, and
    specific safe /dev files (null/zero/random/urandom/full/tty).
    Critically, $HOME is NOT readable — so a compromised PoC cannot
    exfiltrate ~/.ssh, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.config/raptor/models.json,
    etc. If a specific tool needs more, pass readable_paths=[...] to
    extend, or pass restrict_reads=False to opt back into the old
    read-everywhere behaviour (please don't unless absolutely necessary
    — credential exfil is the primary attack surface here).

    `fake_home` also defaults to True: the child's HOME and XDG_*_HOME
    point at `{output}/.home/` (an empty per-sandbox directory) so the
    child sees a clean home containing no dotfiles. Complements
    restrict_reads by converting HOME-denial from "Landlock blocks the
    read" into "the file isn't there to be read" — tools that
    hard-fail on EACCES now get ENOENT (or an empty home) and fall
    back to defaults. Pre-populate `{output}/.home/` before calling
    run_untrusted() if the child needs specific files in its home.

    For compiling/running LLM-generated code, running target binaries,
    invoking target build scripts, or anything else where the command or
    its inputs trace back to untrusted material.

    `**kwargs` forwards to run() — composable with audit/audit_verbose

    profile= (override the default 'full' if absolutely needed),
    caller_label=, env=, cwd=, etc. Forbidden via TypeError:

    """Variant of :func:`run_untrusted` that allows hostname-allowlisted
    HTTPS egress instead of full network block.

    Use case: an LLM-driven sub-agent or tool that must reach a known
    upstream API (e.g. ``api.anthropic.com``) but is otherwise treated
    as adversarial — Claude Code dispatches, future LLM-callers that
    need network. ``run_untrusted()``'s namespace-level network block
    makes those calls impossible; ad-hoc :func:`sandbox()` callers
    forget to set ``restrict_reads=True`` and lose credential isolation
    on Landlock-only hosts (Ubuntu 24.04+ default — see
    ``core/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`` I2-(a)).

    This helper enforces the safe defaults for that case:

      * ``restrict_reads=True`` — kernel-level read allowlist; $HOME
        is denied. Callers that need extra paths pass
        ``readable_paths=[...]``.
      * ``fake_home=False`` — Claude Code reads ``~/.claude.json`` and
        is incompatible with HOME-redirection; callers with no such
        constraint can override.
      * ``use_egress_proxy=True`` + ``proxy_hosts=[...]`` — egress
        proxy with hostname allowlist (the only network this child can
        reach is the listed hosts on port 443).
      * ``allowed_tcp_ports=[443]`` — only HTTPS to the proxy.
      * ``block_network=False`` — must be False so the proxy is
        reachable from inside the sandbox.

    Mirrors :func:`run_untrusted`'s stdin / start_new_session
    defaults — DEVNULL stdin, setsid — for the same passive-sniffer +
    controlling-tty reasons.

    No callers in this PR. Provides the safe shape for future
    cc_dispatch-style migrations to use; see THREAT_MODEL.md.
