"""Legacy: shell-script-based mount-namespace setup.

SUPERSEDED by `core.sandbox._spawn.run_sandboxed` + `core.sandbox.mount_ns`,
which do the same work via ctypes syscalls inside a forked child, in the
right order for kernel 6.17 / Landlock ABI 7 (mount ops BEFORE
landlock_restrict_self). The shell-script path is no longer reachable
from `sandbox().run()` — `context.py` either dispatches to `_spawn` or
falls back to a Landlock-only subprocess chain.

This module is kept for two reasons:

  1. Back-compat tests (test_sandbox.py::test_build_mount_script_*) cover
     argv-injection defences (`--` separator, shlex.quote, etc.) that
     predate `_spawn`. The tests still assert the same invariants we
     want from `mount_ns.setup_mount_ns` — removing them would drop the
     negative-path coverage.

  2. It documents the old mkdir-at-`/` failure mode: on permissive
     sysctl configurations, `mkdir /target` at the root filesystem fails
     because `/` is owned by real uid 0 and our user-ns uid 0 maps to
     the caller uid for ACL checks. `_spawn`'s pivot_root-onto-tmpfs
     design closes that class of bug.

Absolute paths (`mount`, `mkdir`) are still used to defeat PATH
hijacking, consistent with every other spawn point in the sandbox.
