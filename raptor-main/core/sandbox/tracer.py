"""Ptrace tracer subprocess for `--audit` mode.

Spawned by the sandbox parent when audit mode is engaged. Attaches via
PTRACE_SEIZE to the sandboxed child, listens for SECCOMP_RET_TRACE
events (set up by core/sandbox/seccomp.py's audit_mode filter), reads
the offending syscall via PTRACE_GETREGSET, and writes a structured
JSONL denial record directly to the run's
`<run_dir>/.sandbox-denials.jsonl` file (POSIX O_APPEND atomicity —
same trick `core.sandbox.summary.record_denial` uses).

Why a separate process rather than a thread inside RAPTOR:
- ptrace + multi-threaded parents fight for signal delivery: SIGCHLD
  for the traced child, signals to the tracer thread, and ordinary
  RAPTOR signal handling all collide. A dedicated tracer process
  decouples the signal landscape entirely.
- Tracer crash doesn't take down the whole RAPTOR run.
- Cleaner lifecycle isolation — sandbox parent can wait on the
  tracer's exit independently of its own work.

Architecture:
- Sandbox parent forks the target child AND this tracer.
- Child waits in a SIGSTOP'd state (set up by _spawn.py via a sync
  pipe — the child blocks on a read until the parent writes the
  "go" byte).
- This tracer process attaches via PTRACE_SEIZE, sets options,
  signals "ready" to the parent.
- Parent unblocks the child.
- Tracer enters event loop until child exits.

x86_64 + aarch64. Register-read code uses PTRACE_GETREGSET / NT_PRSTATUS;
new arches are added by appending to _ARCH_INFO (one syscall table
per arch + one register-layout entry).

**Yama scope 1 constraint (commit-4 hazard).** This tracer attaches
to a target via PTRACE_SEIZE. Yama scope 1 (the default on Ubuntu /
Debian / Fedora) only permits tracing one's own descendants — siblings
are forbidden. So commit-4 spawn integration must EITHER:
  (a) make the tracer fork the target itself (target is a descendant
      of the tracer process), OR
  (b) have the target call prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, tracer_pid) before
      exec, declaring the tracer as an authorised tracer of this
      specific target.
The tracer code itself works for either relationship; callers of
`trace()` are responsible for setting up the Yama-permissible
arrangement.

**Tracer-death contract (commit-4 hazard).** If the tracer process
dies while the target is mid-trace, all tracees are immediately
SIGKILL'd by the kernel (PTRACE_O_EXITKILL is set on attach). This
is different from b1 (egress proxy crash → sandbox continues without
proxy). Commit-4 spawn integration must monitor the tracer's health
so the operator gets a clear "audit infrastructure failed" message
rather than mysterious SIGKILLs in the target's output.

**Audit mode is observable to traced code (anti-debug surface).**
Code running inside an audited sandbox can detect that it's being
traced — `/proc/self/status` exposes `TracerPid: <our pid>`, and
the typical ptrace-detection idioms (`ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...)`
self-test, syscall timing measurement, `/proc/self/syscall` reads)
all work normally. Hiding this would require process-namespace
games or an eBPF /proc rewriter — both out of scope.

This is acceptable for RAPTOR's threat model: audit mode is for
operator workflows (gcc/make/python builds, claude sub-agents)
that don't try to detect or evade observation. RAPTOR is NOT a
malware-analysis sandbox; if that use case ever lands, the
anti-anti-debug story is a separate engineering effort (PID-ns
isolation, syscall timing normalization, /proc lying, etc.) — not
a tweak to this tracer.

Invocation:
    python -m core.sandbox.tracer <child_pid> <run_dir> [<sync_fd> [<config_path>]]

The sync_fd is an optional file descriptor inherited from the parent
on which we write a single byte once attach + setoptions have
succeeded. Used by _spawn.py to coordinate the "tracer is ready,
unblock the child" handshake. When omitted, no handshake is performed.

The config_path is an optional path to a JSON file containing audit-
mode filter configuration (writable_paths, read_allowlist,
allowed_tcp_ports, verbose flag). When omitted, the tracer runs in
unfiltered (verbose) mode — every traced syscall produces a record.

Required when omitted: nothing (testing path).
Required when present: pid + run_dir + sync_fd + config_path
positional ordering. Both ends — _spawn.py constructs argv, this
module parses it — must agree on positional ordering. See the
TestTracerArgvContract structural test.

    would see it.

    Rules (matching openat(2) semantics):
    - Absolute path: return as-is, lexically normalised.
    - Relative path + AT_FDCWD: resolve via ``/proc/<pid>/cwd``.
    - Relative path + real dirfd: resolve via ``/proc/<pid>/fd/<dirfd>``
      (which symlinks to the directory the fd refers to).

    Failure modes (return the input path unchanged): /proc not
    available, readlink permission denied, stale fd. Better to log
    the un-resolved path than to drop the record entirely — the
    operator can still tell what the target tried even if we couldn't
    pin down where.

    Multi-thread caveat: ``/proc/<pid>/cwd`` is per-task on Linux.
    We use the tid (the tracee's pid as kernel-level thread id) so
    multi-threaded targets that unshare CLONE_FS get correct results.
    The same path also works for single-threaded targets where
    pid == tid for the main thread.

    TOCTOU caveat: by the time we readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd, the
    target may have chdir'd. Best-effort. For audit purposes this is
    acceptable — if the target races us, we under-report rather
    than over-report (same audit-mode promise as elsewhere).

    Mount-namespace assumption: this resolution gives the path as
    the TRACER (parent ns) sees it, not as the tracee's mount-ns
    sees it. This is correct for RAPTOR's standard sandbox layout
    where _spawn.py bind-mounts target/output at their ORIGINAL
    absolute paths inside the pivoted root — the tracee's
    `/etc/hostname` resolves to the same dentry as the parent's
    `/etc/hostname` because /etc is bind-mounted at /etc. Custom
    mount-ns layouts that move target paths to different mount
    points inside the sandbox WOULD see audit-allowlist mismatch.
    Document and constrain at the spawn layer if such layouts are

       - PTRACE_EVENT_FORK / VFORK / CLONE: extract new tracee PID
         via PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG, add to traced set. Kernel has
         auto-attached the new child; its SIGSTOP arrives on a
