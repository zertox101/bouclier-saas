"""Landlock filesystem + TCP-connect restriction.

Landlock works without mount namespaces, without privileges, and without
AppArmor exceptions. It restricts filesystem access via syscall filtering.

ABI levels (kernel):
- 1 (5.13+)  : basic filesystem write restriction
- 2 (5.19+)  : + REFER (cross-directory rename/link)
- 3 (6.2+)   : + TRUNCATE (O_TRUNC on existing files)
- 4 (6.7+)   : + NET_CONNECT_TCP (TCP allowlist)

We build the write-access mask at runtime based on the kernel's ABI, so
a newer kernel gives more coverage; an older one degrades cleanly.
