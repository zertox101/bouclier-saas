"""Local HTTPS egress proxy for sandboxed subprocesses.

Closes two gaps in the `allowed_tcp_ports=[443]` posture that `cc_dispatch`
and similar Claude-sub-agent callers had to rely on:

1. UDP exfil: Landlock's network rule is TCP-CONNECT only, so a
   compromised sub-agent could previously exfiltrate via DNS/UDP. When
   this proxy is used, callers enable the seccomp UDP block (see
   seccomp.py) — the child has no direct network at all, and every
   outbound connection has to land on the proxy's TCP port, which
   enforces a hostname allowlist.
2. Port-only allowlist: Landlock's TCP allowlist is `(port)` not
   `(host, port)`. A sub-agent with `allowed_tcp_ports=[443]` could
   reach any server on :443, including localhost services (e.g., a
   dev-mode internal HTTPS app). With this proxy, only the proxy's
   ephemeral loopback port is reachable; the proxy validates the
   destination hostname and refuses anything outside the allowlist.

Architecture:
- In-process: runs on a daemon thread inside RAPTOR's Python process.
  No subprocess, no IPC, no lifecycle hooks. Daemon thread terminates
  automatically on interpreter exit; `atexit` handler closes sockets
  as defense-in-depth.
- asyncio event loop in the daemon thread handles many concurrent
  tunnels without thread-per-connection. RAPTOR's main code stays
  fully synchronous — callers just see `get_proxy().port` as an int.
- HTTP CONNECT method only. Proxy tunnels raw TLS bytes between child
  and backend; it does NOT terminate TLS (no MITM, no cert forging).
- Hostname allowlist is UNION across all callers: if cc_dispatch asks
  for {api.anthropic.com} and a later caller asks for {ghcr.io}, both
  hosts are allowed globally. Trust model: RAPTOR's own code is the
  only thing that registers hosts, and all sandboxed children are
  equally untrusted. Per-caller allowlists would require mapping each
  TCP connection back to its originating caller, which isn't worth
  the complexity given the threat model.

Safety hooks baked in:
- Bind: 127.0.0.1 only, NEVER 0.0.0.0. Checked at socket setup.
- Ephemeral port: assigned by the kernel (bind port 0). No collision
  with whatever else is on the box, no well-known port to probe.
- Host validation: resolve the CONNECT target once per tunnel, reject
  if the resolved IP is loopback, private (RFC 1918), link-local, or
  multicast. Stops a compromised child from using the proxy to reach
  internal services on the host's LAN.
- DNS pinning: one resolve per tunnel, then connect to that exact IP.
  No mid-tunnel re-resolution — removes the DNS-rebinding window.
- Idle timeout: 300s. Total tunnel duration cap: 3600s. Either bound
  limits how long one compromised child can hold resources open.
- Concurrent tunnels: capped at 64 (configurable). Hard limit on
  resource consumption by a runaway child.
- Buffer size: 64 KiB per direction. Bounds memory per tunnel.
- Audit log: every CONNECT logs {host, port, result, bytes}, INFO level.
- No Proxy-Authorization: localhost-only bind + same-UID trust model.

HTTP CONNECT protocol (RFC 7231 §4.3.6):
    CONNECT host:port HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: host:port\r\n
    (optional headers)\r\n
    \r\n

Response:
    HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established\r\n\r\n
    (then raw bytes in both directions)

Error responses:
    400 Bad Request       — malformed CONNECT line
    403 Forbidden         — host not in allowlist OR resolved to blocked IP
    502 Bad Gateway       — backend refused / unreachable
    504 Gateway Timeout   — backend didn't respond within timeout

#   256 — first bump (#407). Helped marginally but ``npm install
#         --maxsockets=8`` STILL bursts to ~280 concurrent tunnels

#         tunnels for ``debug``, peak 298 for ``eslint``.
#   1024 — interim (#411). Looked safe at first; later sampling at

#         655 for ``eslint`` (earlier 250ms-tick samples missed the

    Called for two cases in audit mode:
    - gate 1 (host not in allowlist) audit-fall-through: the CONNECT
      succeeds and the child sees nothing, so the proxy has to emit
      the record itself or it never lands in the summary.
    - gate 2 (resolved IP blocked) deny: gate 2 stays enforcing in

        Pre-fix `stop()` called `self._loop.stop` immediately, which
        terminated in-flight CONNECT tunnels mid-stream. Tunnels that
        had completed their TLS handshake but not yet finished proxying
        bytes were dropped — clients saw connection-reset mid-request,
        and the proxy's audit-log entries for those tunnels were
        truncated.

        With `drain_timeout > 0` we first stop ACCEPTING new connections
        (close the server socket via `_server.close()`), then wait up to
        `drain_timeout` seconds for existing tunnels to complete
        naturally before stopping the event loop. New connections that
        arrive during the drain window get connection-refused at the
        OS level, which is the correct behaviour for a graceful
        shutdown.

        Set `drain_timeout=0` to preserve the legacy abrupt-stop
        behaviour (callers that need synchronous teardown for tests).
