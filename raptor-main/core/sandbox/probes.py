"""Availability probes for the user-namespace layers.

`check_net_available()` tests `unshare --user --net`; `check_mount_available()`
tests bind-mount capability (requires uidmap + no AppArmor restriction).
Both results are cached per-process — the cost of probing is a subprocess
spawn, done at most once.

Landlock and seccomp have their own probes in landlock.py and seccomp.py
respectively, because those tests are syscall-level (ctypes) rather than
subprocess-level.
