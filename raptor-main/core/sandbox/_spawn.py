"""Fork-based sandbox-spawn helper.

Provides `run_sandboxed()` — a subprocess.run() replacement that supports
the ordering subprocess.Popen(preexec_fn=...) cannot: uid_map setup via
`newuidmap` (requires cooperation between parent and child), mount
operations (must run before Landlock install), and then Landlock/seccomp
install inside the child — all before the final execvp.

Why this exists:
    subprocess.Popen with preexec_fn runs preexec in a forked child that
    has already lost access to the parent's newuidmap invocation path,
    and runs Landlock BEFORE any mount ops. Kernel 6.15+ Landlock blocks
    mount topology changes once restrict_self has been called, so the
    legacy shell-script mount flow fails when mount-ns activates.

    The newuidmap helper (setuid-root, ships in the `uidmap` package) is
    the correct way to set up a user-ns with root-mapping under
    unprivileged operation. But newuidmap writes happen FROM THE PARENT
    against the child's /proc/<pid>/uid_map — requiring a synchronisation
    pipe between parent and child.

Flow:

    parent                              child (os.fork'd)
    ------                              -----------------
    1. os.pipe() × 2 (sync + stdout/stderr capture)
    2. os.fork() ─────────────────────▶ 3. os.unshare(USER|NS|IPC|[NET])
    4. wait for child 'ready'          5. write 'ready' to sync pipe
    6. newuidmap / newgidmap           7. wait for parent 'go'
    8. write 'go' to sync pipe ──────▶ 9. setup_mount_ns()  (ctypes mount)
                                       10. landlock_restrict_self()
                                       11. install seccomp filter
                                       12. os.unshare(NEWPID); os.fork()
                                       13.  grandchild: execvp(cmd)
    14. waitpid(child), collect output

Graceful degrade:
    - If newuidmap is missing or fails: skip mount-ns, fall back to the
      existing subprocess+preexec Landlock-only path. Caller checks
      `mount_ns_available()` before invoking.
    - If any single mount op in setup_mount_ns fails: raise; caller's
      fallback takes over.
    - If Landlock/seccomp install fails in child: abort child via
      os._exit(126); parent observes and returns non-zero.
