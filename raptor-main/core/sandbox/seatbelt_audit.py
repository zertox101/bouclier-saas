"""macOS audit-mode log capture.

When ``--audit`` is engaged on macOS, the SBPL profile uses
``(allow file-write* (with report))`` — the write succeeds AND the
kernel Sandbox.kext emits an entry to the unified log. This module
streams those entries live via ``log stream``, parses them, and
appends RAPTOR-format records to ``<run_dir>/.sandbox-denials.jsonl``
— matching the JSONL schema produced by the Linux ptrace tracer so
the existing ``summarize_and_write`` aggregation works unchanged.

Spike-validated facts (see scripts/macos_sandbox_spike4.py):

  * Sandbox kext entries have ``subsystem=""`` and ``category=""`` —
    cannot filter on those.
  * The reliable filter is ``senderImagePath ==
    "/System/Library/Extensions/Sandbox.kext/Contents/MacOS/Sandbox"``.
  * eventMessage format:
        ``Sandbox: <ProcessName>(<PID>) <verdict> <action> <path>``
    where verdict ∈ {allow, deny} and action is e.g. file-write-create,
    file-read-data, network-outbound.

Threading: the streamer runs as a daemon thread that reads
``log stream`` ndjson output line-by-line. Daemon=True so it doesn't
block process shutdown. ``stop()`` terminates the underlying
subprocess.

Per-call lifecycle: caller in _macos_spawn starts the streamer just
before running the sandboxed workload and stops it after. The brief
warm-up window is acceptable — sandbox events arrive within tens of
milliseconds of the workload's syscall, well within the post-workload
drain period.
