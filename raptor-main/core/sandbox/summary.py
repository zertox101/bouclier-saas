"""Per-run sandbox denial summary.

Aggregates sandbox enforcement events (network blocked, write blocked, syscall
killed) across all sandbox calls in a run, producing a structured
``sandbox-summary.json`` with suggested-fix hints. Useful regardless of profile
— even on ``--sandbox full``, operators benefit from a clean post-run report
of what their workflow tried that the sandbox blocked, instead of grepping
log lines.

Design:
- ``set_active_run_dir(path)`` is called by ``core/run/metadata.py:start_run``
  and cleared at run end.
- ``record_denial(...)`` is called by ``core/sandbox/observe.py:_check_blocked``
  for each detected denial. Appends one JSONL line to
  ``<run_dir>/.sandbox-denials.jsonl``.
- ``summarize_and_write(run_dir)`` is called by ``core/run/metadata.py``
  ``complete_run`` / ``fail_run`` / ``cancel_run``. Reads the JSONL, writes
  ``sandbox-summary.json``, removes the intermediate JSONL.

JSONL append is atomic on POSIX up to PIPE_BUF (~4KB) so concurrent writers
within the same run (multi-threaded callers) don't corrupt each other. Each
record is well under PIPE_BUF in practice — `cmd_display` is bounded by
``_CMD_DISPLAY_MAX_ARGS`` (3 args) and escape_nonprintable'd before reaching
us. Pathologically long cmd args could exceed PIPE_BUF; defer that defense
until it surfaces.

Concurrency assumption: the design assumes a single-process, single-active-run
model. Concurrent threads within a process can record_denial safely (POSIX
append atomicity). The cross-thread case where one thread is mid-write while
another thread calls summarize_and_write (which unlinks the JSONL after
aggregating) is a real but academic race — A's write lands in an orphaned
inode and is silently lost. If a future caller actually needs concurrent
finalize, add a per-run lock around record_denial / summarize_and_write.

Multiprocessing caveat: ``_active_run_dir`` is a module global, so child
processes spawned via ``multiprocessing.Pool`` (or fork+exec from Python)
inherit ``None`` (or whatever the parent had at fork time, depending on
the start method). Children's ``record_denial`` calls would no-op unless
the child explicitly re-establishes active-run state. Today's RAPTOR
parallelism uses ThreadPoolExecutor (same process, shared state) so this
isn't a current gap; future authors reaching for ``multiprocessing.Pool``
should call ``set_active_run_dir(run_dir)`` in the worker initializer.

Opt-out: there's no env var or flag to disable the summary. If a caller
genuinely doesn't want it (CI noise, perf-sensitive batch), call
``set_active_run_dir(None)`` after start_run. Per the project's "avoid
RAPTOR_* env var proliferation" feedback, opt-out via env var is not
provided.

    """Retroactive summarize CLI.

    Rarely needed in normal operation: ``core.run.metadata._cleanup_abandoned``
    already finalizes the summary for the common Esc-then-retry case (same
    Claude Code session, same command type) by promoting the prior run from
    ``status=running`` to ``failed`` — which routes through ``fail_run`` and
    therefore through the standard ``_finalize_sandbox_summary`` path.

    This CLI is the explicit fallback for cases the auto-recovery doesn't
    cover: a hard kill, a different session, a different command type, or
    operator-driven cleanup of a project dir with several stranded runs.

    Two modes:

        # Single-run mode — finalize one specific run dir.
        libexec/raptor-sandbox-summary <run_dir>

        # Sweep mode — finalize ALL stranded runs under a project dir.
        # Iterates direct subdirectories, finalizes any with a leftover
        # .sandbox-denials.jsonl, skips the rest. Useful for one-off
        # cleanup of a project that accumulated abandoned runs across
        # past sessions.
        libexec/raptor-sandbox-summary --sweep <project_dir>

    The ``python -m core.sandbox.summary`` form also works but emits a
    runpy double-import warning (``core.sandbox.__init__`` imports
    ``observe``, which imports this module before runpy executes it as
    ``__main__``). Prefer the libexec shim, which sidesteps runpy.
