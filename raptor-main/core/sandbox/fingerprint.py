"""Host-fingerprint sanitisation overlay for sandboxed children.

Opt-in via `sandbox(..., sanitise_host_fingerprint=True)`. When engaged,
the mount-ns child bind-mounts canonical files over the host's identity
surfaces and the spawn machinery sets a canonical UTS namespace +
sched_setaffinity mask:

  /proc/cpuinfo                          → N blocks, host flags preserved
  /proc/version                          → "Linux version <host-release>\\n"
  /proc/cmdline                          → canonical stub
  /proc/stat                             → aggregate + N per-cpu lines
  /etc/os-release                        → Debian 12 stub
  /etc/machine-id                        → deterministic-pseudo-random
  /etc/hostname                          → "localhost"
  /sys/class/dmi/id/sys_vendor           → "QEMU"
  /sys/class/dmi/id/product_name         → "Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)"
  /sys/devices/system/cpu/online         → 0..N-1
  /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible       → 0..N-1
  uname() nodename                       → "localhost"
  uname() domainname                     → "localdomain"
  sched_getaffinity                      → bits 0..N-1

Persona = "boring Debian 12 cloud VM on QEMU/KVM with Intel Xeon" —
picked for hide-intent (most common Linux workload; doesn't tip off
the sandbox). All sentinel-looking values that would identify us as
analysis infrastructure ("sandbox" hostname, all-zero machine-id,
"Generic x86_64 CPU" model) are deliberately avoided.

What's PRESERVED from the host (capability surface, not identity):
  - /proc/cpuinfo `flags` line (SMEP/SMAP detection in
    packages/exploit_feasibility, SIMD dispatch, ASAN shadow-mem)
  - uname() sysname (always "Linux"), release (kernel version for
    exploit_feasibility's `uname -r`), machine (arch — shellcode
    payload dispatch needs it)
  - /proc/sys/kernel/{randomize_va_space, kptr_restrict,
    yama/ptrace_scope}, /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr (mitigation reads)
  - /proc/self/* (maps, exe, status, auxv — ASAN, GDB, pwntools
    context.aslr depend on real values)

Residuals (documented; not addressed by this module):
  - CPUID asm bypass — direct cpuid execution reads real CPU; fix
    needs ptrace syscall rewriting + userspace emulator (out of scope).
  - AT_HWCAP auxiliary vector — kernel-supplied at exec; not file-based.
  - Vendor preservation via flags-line — Intel-vs-AMD distinguishable
    via flag-set differences (e.g. AMD-specific flags). Trade-off for
    SIMD compat.

Platform support: Linux only. macOS lacks unprivileged bind-mount +
UTS-namespace primitives, and most host-identity reads on macOS are
syscall/IOKit-based (sysctlbyname, IORegistryEntry) — not file-based.
`is_supported()` returns False on non-Linux; callers should soft-
degrade with a one-shot WARNING (matching the pattern used by
restrict_reads when Landlock is unavailable).

# Use case: callers like `codeql database create` that engage a
# target-repo parallel build (make -j$(nproc), mvn -T NC). Pinning
# to the default cpu_count=4 on a 32-core CI host causes ~8x build
# slowdown and pushes long builds past CODEQL_TIMEOUT.
# HOST_CPU_COUNT preserves real parallelism while still masking
# identity (model name, vendor, microcode, hostname, machine-id,
