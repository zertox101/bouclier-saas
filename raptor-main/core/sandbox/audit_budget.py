"""Centralised audit-record rate / volume control.

Used by both backends:
  * core.sandbox.tracer            — Linux ptrace tracer
  * core.sandbox.seatbelt_audit    — macOS log-stream reader

A single source of truth for the budget mechanics keeps the two
backends from drifting and means a future tweak (new category, new
sampling rate, new CLI knob) lands in one place.

Four mechanisms compose:

  1. Global cap (`global_cap`). Hard ceiling on total records per
     run. Once hit, EVERY record is evaluated through sampling
     (defaulting to drop for un-sampled categories).

  2. Per-category sub-cap (`category_caps`). Stops one chatty
     category (file-read-metadata, process-info-*) from squeezing
     low-volume but operationally-important categories (network,
     exec, mach-lookup) out of the global budget.

  3. Per-PID sub-cap (`pid_cap`). One spamming subprocess can't
     dominate the JSONL — past the per-PID cap, that PID's records
     are dropped (with a one-time marker per PID).

  4. Token-bucket rate limiting (`refill_rates`). The cap is a
     burst capacity; the refill rate is the steady-state allowance.
     A long-running audited workload that legitimately produces
     events at e.g. 10/sec for an hour DOESN'T blow through the
     burst cap — the bucket refills as it drains.

  5. Post-cap sampling (`sampling_rates`). Once a category's burst
     cap is hit, instead of going completely dark the budget can
     emit 1-in-N records. Operators see "is this still happening?"
     at a fraction of the volume.

Decision return shape:
    (action: str, marker: dict | None)

  action:  "keep" → caller writes the record
           "drop" → caller drops silently
  marker:  dict to append to the JSONL BEFORE acting on the action
           (the caller writes the marker first, then either writes
           the record or drops it). None when no marker is needed.
           Markers fire ONCE per category-cap-exhaust and ONCE per
           pid-cap-exhaust so operators see the suppression in-line.

Thread-safety: each backend's writer is single-threaded (Linux
tracer is a separate process, macOS LogStreamer has one daemon
reader thread), so no internal locking. Two budgets in the same
process must not share state.

CLI:
  --audit-budget N   set the global cap to N (CLI override of the
                     default global_cap=10000). Per-category caps
                     are scaled proportionally so the relative
                     allocation is preserved.

# Defaults — STARTING HEURISTICS, not measured truths.

# These were picked by inspection from a few /scan + /agentic runs
# and Apple's open-source SBPL profiles. They are NOT calibrated
# against a corpus of real workloads. After first production
# deployment, measure the distributions in real `audit_summary`
# records (see core.sandbox.summary aggregation):
#
#   * If a category disappears entirely into `dropped_by_category`
#     while the workload is still producing useful events, raise
#     that category's cap and refill rate.
#   * If the JSONL bloats past operational tolerance under
#     `--audit-verbose`, tighten the high-volume categories
#     (file-read-metadata, process-info) further OR add a sampling
#     rate to a category that currently has none.
#   * If a long-running workload (>1 hour) drains its bucket at
#     steady-state, raise that category's `refill_rate` rather than
#     its cap — caps absorb bursts; refill rate absorbs sustained
#     load.
#
# Operators tuning per-deployment can override via
# AuditBudget(global_cap=..., category_caps=..., refill_rates=...,
# sampling_rates=...). The CLI flag --audit-budget=N propagates the
# global override and scales per-category and per-PID sub-caps
