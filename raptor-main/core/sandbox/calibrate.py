"""Generic sandbox-binary calibration.

Build a reproducible "fingerprint" of what an external binary touches
when it runs — filesystem paths it reads/writes/stats AND outbound
hostnames it tries to reach. The fingerprint is keyed on
``(sha256(realpath(binary)), env_signature)`` and cached on disk so
repeat callers don't re-spawn the binary every invocation.

Why generalise:
    Hardcoded sandbox allowlists drift silently across binary versions
    and operator setups. Examples:
      * Anthropic adds a new endpoint → cc_dispatch's hardcoded
        ``api.anthropic.com`` allowlist breaks.
      * Operator points pip at a corporate index → ``pypi.org`` is
        never touched, ``pypi.corp.example`` is.
      * codeql on a GHE host pulls packs from ``ghe.corp.example``
        instead of ``github.com``.
    Auto-calibration resolves the actual reach empirically and
    surfaces a profile the operator (or downstream allowlist code)
    can consume.

Threat model:
    Calibration is a portability / drift-detection tool, NOT a
    security feature. The probe runs the binary once with a
    permissive policy — by the time we observe its behaviour, the
    binary has already executed. Defense against malicious binary
    updates lives upstream (signed installers, package-hash
    verification). The cache itself is mode-0600 with sha256 self-
    integrity check; tampering by an attacker who can write
    ``~/.cache/raptor/`` is bounded by the attacker's existing
    same-UID access.

API:
    calibrate_binary(bin_path, probe_args, *, env_keys=()) → SandboxProfile
        Spawn the probe synchronously, return the fresh profile,
        and cache it. Used by power callers that always want a
        live measurement.
    load_or_calibrate(bin_path, probe_args, *, env_keys=(), force=False)
        Cache-first variant. The default cc_dispatch consumer
        path. ``force=True`` skips the cache and recalibrates.
    clear_cache(bin_path=None)
        Drop one or all cache entries. ``raptor sandbox calibrate
        --clear`` calls this.

    Filesystem fields (paths_*) come from observe-mode tracer
    records: every open()/openat()/stat() the binary issues during
    the probe.

    Network fields:
      proxy_hosts
        HOSTNAMES the binary attempted to reach via the egress
        proxy. This is the load-bearing field for downstream
        consumers like cc_dispatch — proxy_hosts maps directly to
        the ``proxy_hosts=`` kwarg of ``sandbox()``.
      connect_targets
        Raw IP:port from tracer connect() records. Diagnostic only;
        callers should NOT use this as an allowlist (IP-based
        allowlisting fails on CDNs, anycast, multi-region cloud
        endpoints). Kept so an operator inspecting a profile can
        see what fell outside the proxy.

    Identity fields:
      binary_sha256
        sha256 of the resolved binary's content. Re-checked on
        cache load; mismatch triggers recalibration. Defeats stale
        caches after binary updates.
      env_signature
        sha256 of the relevant env-var subset at calibration time.
        Two profiles for the same binary differ when the relevant
        env (e.g. PIP_INDEX_URL) differs.
      captured_at
        ISO-8601 UTC. Diagnostic only — the cache is keyed by
        fingerprint, not age.
      probe_args
        Argv passed to the binary during calibration. Operators
        replaying calibration use the same args.
      cache_version
