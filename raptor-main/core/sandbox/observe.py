"""Post-run result interpretation and enforcement detection.

Two functions:
- `_interpret_result()`: reads the subprocess result (signal, stderr) and
  attaches a structured `sandbox_info` dict with crash / resource-exceeded /
  sanitizer state.
- `_check_blocked()`: scans stderr for patterns that indicate a sandbox
  layer fired, enriches `sandbox_info["blocked"]` accordingly. Each
  category is only reported when its layer is actually engaged for the
  call, so we don't claim enforcement on an unsandboxed run.

Nothing here is on the hot path of subprocess execution; both functions
run in the parent after the child has exited.
