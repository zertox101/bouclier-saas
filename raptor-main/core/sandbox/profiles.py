"""Named sandbox profile definitions.

Profiles are the ONLY legitimate way for a user to downgrade isolation.
They map a human-memorable name onto a coherent set of layer settings.
Kept in a tiny standalone module so both `cli.py` (for argparse choices)
and `context.py` (for profile resolution in sandbox()) can import them
without a circular dependency.

Wrapped in MappingProxyType because `PROFILES` is exposed via __all__ —
a plain dict would let an external caller mutate `PROFILES["full"]
["block_network"] = False` and corrupt the module for every subsequent
sandbox() invocation in the process.

# Profile definitions
# -------------------
# Profiles set ENFORCEMENT strictness. Audit mode is an ORTHOGONAL
# concern engaged by the `--audit` CLI flag (or `audit=True` kwarg)
# and works with any profile that has a seccomp filter (i.e. full or
# debug); on `network-only` it engages only the egress-proxy log-mode
# gate (the other audit layers are no-ops because there's no Landlock
# / seccomp to compare against), and on `none` it errors as
# incoherent.
#
# full:         network blocked + Landlock + seccomp (incl. ptrace) + rlimits.
#               The default. Appropriate for scan/exploit/PoC work.
# debug:        full, but seccomp permits ptrace so gdb/rr can trace the
#               target. Use for /crash-analysis. Target AND debugger run
#               in the same sandbox — debugger forks target as a descendant
#               so ptrace_scope=1 naturally authorises the trace.
#               Composes with --audit so operators can see what would
#               have been blocked while still running gdb/rr.
# network-only: network blocked + rlimits only (no Landlock, no seccomp).
#               For tools whose correctness requires unrestricted fs or
#               syscalls within a build — user's last-resort-short-of-none.
# none:         rlimits only. Emergency escape hatch.
#
# `seccomp` is the profile name passed into _make_seccomp_preexec(); an
# empty string disables seccomp for that profile. The two audit fields
# moved out of the profile dict to CLI flags / per-call kwargs.
