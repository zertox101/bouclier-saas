"""Seccomp-bpf syscall-level filter.

Layered on top of Landlock to close escape vectors Landlock doesn't cover:
AF_UNIX / AF_PACKET / AF_NETLINK socket() (docker.sock escape, raw packets),
ptrace (cross-process attacks on same-UID host processes when ptrace_scope=0),
keyctl/bpf/user_faultfd/perf_event_open (weird-corner syscalls historically
used in container escapes).

Blocklist not allowlist: RAPTOR runs arbitrary target builds, so default-
deny would require per-tool syscall profiles. Blocklist has near-zero
breakage risk because we only block things gcc/make/python/etc. don't use.

Default action: ALLOW. Blocked syscalls return EPERM (not SIGSYS / kill)
so processes fail gracefully — connect() returns -1, caller can handle it,
and _check_blocked can suggest --sandbox debug / network-only if needed.

    Runs POST-fork in the child. Same fork-safety rules as Landlock: capture

    instead of the Python logger (which is not fork-safe).

    `block_udp=True` additionally rejects socket(AF_INET|AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM)
    — enabled by the use_egress_proxy mode in context.sandbox() so that a
    sandboxed child can't do DNS (UDP/53) or any UDP protocol directly.
    With the proxy allowlisting hostnames, the proxy resolves on behalf of
    the child, so UDP client-side is unnecessary. Disabled by default
    because UDP/DNS is needed for normal sandbox use (e.g. block_network=True
    with no proxy — DNS still used inside the net-ns for loopback lookups).

    `audit_mode=True` swaps the deny action from SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(EPERM) to
    SCMP_ACT_TRACE — the kernel pauses the tracee and notifies the
    attached ptrace tracer (core/sandbox/tracer.py) instead of erroring
    the syscall. Also adds open/openat/connect to the trace set for b3
    filesystem + network audit coverage. CRITICAL: requires a ptrace
    tracer to be attached for the target's lifetime; without it, the
    kernel default action for unhandled TRACE is SIGSYS-kill the
    process. The caller (_spawn.py) is responsible for ensuring tracer
    is attached before any traced syscall fires.

    `observe_mode=True` extends the trace set with stat-family syscalls
    (stat/lstat/newfstatat/access/faccessat/faccessat2) on top of the
    audit set. Stat-family events surface "binary probed candidate
    paths" — useful for profile-extraction probes (e.g., calibrating
    Claude Code's filesystem reach) where the question is "what does
    this binary touch", not "what did the sandbox deny". Implies
    audit_mode (TRACE action, tracer attached); enforcement-shape
    audits should leave it off.
