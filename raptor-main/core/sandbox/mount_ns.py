"""Mount-namespace setup via ctypes syscalls.

Runs inside a forked child of `_spawn.run_sandboxed()` after the child has
entered a fresh user-ns (via newuidmap-based mapping in the parent) and
acquired CAP_SYS_ADMIN in that ns. Executes BEFORE Landlock is installed,
because landlock_restrict_self() blocks subsequent mount topology changes
on kernel 6.15+.

Architecture summary — see `core/sandbox/_spawn.py` for the full flow:

    parent:          child (forked):
    1. fork ───────▶ 2. os.unshare(USER|NS|IPC|[NET])
    3. newuidmap ──▶ 4. wait for pipe signal
                     5. setup_mount_ns()   ← this module
                     6. install Landlock
                     7. install seccomp
                     8. os.unshare(NEWPID) + fork-into-new-pid-ns
                     9. execvp(cmd)

The module exposes `setup_mount_ns(target, output)` which:
    1. Makes / rprivate so our mounts don't leak back.
    2. Creates a fresh tmpfs at /tmp/.raptor-sbx-<pid> to become the new root.
    3. Bind-mounts system dirs (/usr, /lib, /lib64, /etc, /bin, /sbin)
       read-only into the new root.
    4. rbind-mounts /dev and /sys from the host.
    5. Mounts fresh tmpfs at /run and /tmp for per-sandbox isolation.
    6. Bind-mounts target (read-only) and output (writable) at their
       ORIGINAL absolute paths (no caller argv rewriting needed).
    7. pivot_root onto the new tmpfs.

Shadow-paths that collide with per-ns mounts (/tmp, /dev, etc.) are
skipped — the per-ns mount already serves them.
