"""macOS sandbox-exec wrapper.

This module mirrors core.sandbox._spawn.run_sandboxed() — same kwarg
contract, same return shape (subprocess.CompletedProcess with
.sandbox_info attached) — so context.py can dispatch to the
appropriate backend (Linux vs Darwin) at the spawn-eligibility check
without callers caring about platform.

                                        per-syscall trace and no argv,
                                        but operationally similar

    map_root (--map-root-user)         → ⚠  no equivalent — sandboxed
                                        process keeps caller UID

Implications of the ⚠ items for the threat model:

  1. PID visibility: a sandboxed child that compromises a same-UID
     process can still see / signal it. Linux's PID-ns hides this.
     Mitigation: don't run RAPTOR alongside other valuable same-UID
     processes; consider a dedicated user account for RAPTOR on
     shared macOS hosts.
  2. Filesystem read scope: under default kwargs the sandboxed
     child can read everything the calling user can. Always pass
     restrict_reads=True for untrusted code (run_untrusted does this
     by default).
  3. RLIMIT_NPROC: a fork-bombing sandboxed child can exhaust the
     calling user's process table host-wide. Lower nproc_limit on
     macOS than on Linux when running unknown code.
  4. audit_verbose granularity: macOS records are SBPL-action-level
     (e.g. "file-read-data /etc/foo") rather than syscall+argv
     level. Linux's tracer can show "openat(/etc/foo, O_RDONLY)";
     macOS can't distinguish reads-of-foo from stats-of-foo. For
     debugging targets that need argv-level fidelity, use Linux.

What's identical and needs no special handling:

  * Resource limits via POSIX setrlimit (preexec_fn pattern).
  * fake_home env override (mirrors Linux's per-XDG-subdir layout
    in core/sandbox/context.py — HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME,
    XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_STATE_HOME each point at a
    distinct subdir of {output}/.home/ so configs don't collide
    with caches).
  * Egress proxy + audit-degraded marker semantics (handled at the
    context.py layer, identical to Linux).
  * Sandbox-summary JSONL aggregation (same schema, same writer).
  * Audit budget: same core.sandbox.audit_budget.AuditBudget on
    both backends — token-bucket + per-category + per-PID +
    1-in-N sampling + --audit-budget CLI override.

    Same return shape as the Linux ``_spawn.run_sandboxed()``; same
    contract for ``audit_mode`` / ``audit_run_dir`` (caller writes
    .sandbox-denials.jsonl into audit_run_dir; we route the kernel
    sandbox log into that file via seatbelt_audit's log streamer).

    observe_mode: when True (with audit_mode=True), the seatbelt
    log streamer routes records to ``.sandbox-observe.jsonl``
    (instead of ``.sandbox-denials.jsonl``) and stamps each record
    with ``"observe": True`` (instead of ``"audit": True``). Mirror
    of the Linux tracer behaviour — profile-extraction probes
    (sandbox(observe=True)) get a separate JSONL file the
    denial-summary aggregator does not consume. On macOS, observe
    signal comes from the same SBPL ``(allow X (with report))``
    rules as audit_verbose; observe_mode therefore implies
    audit_verbose at the SBPL layer (engaged by the upstream
    sandbox() context).

    audit_verbose: when True (with audit_mode=True), engages the
    extended SBPL audit category set in seatbelt.build_profile.
    Each of the following is emitted as `(allow X (with report))`:
      * file-read-data

      * mach-lookup

      * process-info*
      * signal
      * iokit-open
      * sysctl-read
    Closest macOS analogue to Linux's strace-style audit. Less
    fidelity than Linux (no per-syscall, no argv) — see
    seatbelt.build_profile docstring for the rationale on which
    categories are included. High-volume categories
    (file-read-metadata, process-info*, iokit-open, sysctl-read)
