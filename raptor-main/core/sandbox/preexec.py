"""Resource rlimits + preexec_fn composition.

Ties the three isolation layers together into a single preexec_fn that
runs in the forked child after subprocess fork and before exec:
1. resource.setrlimit() for memory / CPU / file-size caps
2. Landlock filesystem + TCP-port rules (landlock.py)
3. Seccomp syscall blocklist (seccomp.py)

Order matters: Landlock's PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS is required by seccomp, so
seccomp installs LAST — inheriting NO_NEW_PRIVS from Landlock's
restrict_self.

# Default resource limits (generous — catch malice, not constrain builds).
#
# `memory_mb` bounds RLIMIT_AS (virtual address space). Disabled by
# default (0 means "skip setrlimit") because ASAN-instrumented binaries
# reserve ~56 TiB of shadow-memory VA on x86_64 and ANY finite limit
# breaks them at startup — including values that far exceed physical
# RAM. Every memory-corruption PoC in /validate uses ASAN, so a tight
# RLIMIT_AS is a non-starter. Callers wanting an actual RAM bound
# should use an external cgroup v2 `memory.max`; rlimit was always a
# weak defence anyway (malicious code can defeat it via many small
# mmaps, and VA limits don't reflect physical RAM usage).
#
# `nproc` is enforced via RLIMIT_NPROC inside the user-namespace only:
# the sandboxed child runs as ns-UID nobody (65534) which has zero
# pre-existing processes, so the limit bounds fork-bomb expansion
# without affecting unrelated RAPTOR work on the host UID. Skipped
# when no user-namespace is active (i.e. Landlock-only / profile=none
# paths) because there the count would apply to the host UID.
