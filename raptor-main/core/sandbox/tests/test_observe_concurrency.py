"""Concurrency tests for observe-mode.

Two scenarios:

  1. Two concurrent sandboxes share the same audit_run_dir. Each
     gets a distinct nonce; their records interleave in the same
     JSONL but each parse_observe_log call (with the right nonce)
     surfaces only its own records. This is the multi-tenant
     contract — without it, calling sandbox(observe=True) twice
     with overlapping output dirs would conflate records.

  2. Atomicity under fast writes. The tracer's _write_record uses
     POSIX O_APPEND semantics, so writes < PIPE_BUF (~4KB) land
     atomically against concurrent writers. We exercise this with
     a workload that produces many traced syscalls in a tight loop
     and assert every line in the JSONL parses cleanly — no
     interleaved torn records.

Both tests are Linux-only and require ptrace + libseccomp.
