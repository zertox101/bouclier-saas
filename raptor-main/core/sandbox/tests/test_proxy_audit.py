"""Tests for the egress proxy's audit-mode (`audit_log_only=True`).

In audit mode the proxy ALLOWS every CONNECT but emits a structured
would-deny event for any request that would have been blocked under
full enforcement (host not in allowlist, or resolved IP in a blocked
range). The audit event is recorded both into the per-sandbox proxy-
events buffer (for live observation) and into the per-run sandbox-
summary.json via core.sandbox.summary.record_denial (for post-run
auditing — operators reading sandbox-summary.json see what would have
been blocked).

Tests open raw sockets to a real EgressProxy instance. No subprocess,
no curl — sockets are sufficient to exercise the gate logic and we
can assert directly on event shape and summary-side records. The E2E
flow (`use_egress_proxy=True` from a sandbox()) is tested separately
in test_e2e_sandbox.py.
