"""Site-level tests for the W36.J.1 audit-degraded marker writes.

The W36.J.1 commits added ``record_audit_degraded`` calls at four
silent-degrade sites under ``audit_mode=True``:

  - ``_spawn.py:411-416`` (F063a: no seccomp_profile)
  - ``_spawn.py:417-424`` (F063b: libseccomp unavailable)
  - ``_spawn.py:585-603`` (F063c: ptrace blocked else-branch)
  - ``_macos_spawn.py:322-352`` (F064: seatbelt log streamer raises)

Each test stubs the precondition that drives the relevant degrade
branch, then invokes the public entry point and asserts that
``<audit_run_dir>/sandbox-audit-degraded.json`` exists with the
expected payload shape.

F063 tests are Linux-only (the silent-degrade paths only run inside the
``if audit_mode:`` block on the Linux backend). F064 is macOS-only
(seatbelt log streamer only attaches there).
