"""Regression tests for F070.

`core/sandbox/seatbelt_audit.py` had seven `except OSError/Exception`
sites in the reader thread and the warm-up gate. Per-site triage:

  L284  warm_up.terminate() cleanup after warm-up itself raised
        -> INTENTIONAL cleanup of an already-dead process; KEEP, add
        rationale comment.

  L332  subprocess.Popen of the warm-up `sandbox-exec` binary failed
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING. Without it the warm-up gate
        returns False on a totally-silent OSError and the operator
        never knows why their audit run started without a warm-up.

  L391  warm_up.terminate() inside the gate's selector-loop finally
        -> INTENTIONAL cleanup of a process that may already be dead;
        KEEP, add rationale.

  L447  JSONL append failed inside _read_loop's inner block
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING. Mirrors F069 family-wide rationale
        (operators rarely run with DEBUG, so audit-record loss was
        previously invisible).

  L453  Top-level Exception in _read_loop crashes the reader thread
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING. A dead reader thread means ALL
        subsequent audit records are lost; this must not be invisible.

  L546  Summary record append at stop() failed
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING. Same rationale as L447.

  L557  os.close(self._dirfd) cleanup in stop()
        -> INTENTIONAL cleanup of an fd that may already be invalid;
        KEEP, add rationale.

So: 4 promote (L332, L447, L453, L546) + 3 keep-with-rationale
(L284, L391, L557). The promoted four are the ones that signal a
*loss of audit information*; the kept three signal *cleanup attempts
on best-effort cleanup paths* where additional logging would be
noise.

This test file covers the 4 promoted sites by patching the underlying
operation to raise and asserting WARNING is emitted.
