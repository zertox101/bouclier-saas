"""Regression tests for F071.

`core/sandbox/summary.py` had several `except OSError/Exception` sites
that swallowed I/O failures at DEBUG (or silently). Per-site triage:

  L191  record_denial JSONL append failure
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING. Sandbox-denial record loss must be
        visible to operators; mirrors F069/F070 family.

  L294  record_audit_degraded tmp.unlink cleanup
        -> KEEP-SILENT. Cleanup path; missing_ok=True already used.

  L334  summarize_and_write os.replace(jsonl, tmp) OSError
        -> KEEP-SILENT. This is the race-lost branch (sibling already
        renamed and is summarising). Not data loss — the other party
        is producing the summary. Returns None correctly.

  L349  summarize_and_write open(tmp) read OSError
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING (currently silent return None).
        This drops the entire summary; operator must know.

  L352  L349's tmp.unlink cleanup
        -> KEEP-SILENT. Cleanup path.

  L359  successful-path tmp.unlink
        -> KEEP-SILENT. Cleanup of drained file.

  L403  summarize_and_write summary-write os.replace OSError
        -> PROMOTE DEBUG -> WARNING (currently silent return None).
        Silent loss of the run's final summary; operator must know.
        The sentinel (return None) is correct contract; this just
        adds operator visibility.

  L406  L403's tmp.unlink cleanup
        -> KEEP-SILENT. Cleanup path.

So: 3 promote (L191, L349, L403) + 5 keep-with-rationale. The
promoted three are the data-loss-visibility sites; the kept five are
cleanup paths where logging would be noise.
