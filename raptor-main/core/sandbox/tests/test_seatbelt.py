"""SBPL profile generation tests — cross-platform.

These tests exercise ``core.sandbox.seatbelt.build_profile`` purely as
string generation; they don't invoke ``sandbox-exec`` so they run on
Linux too. The macOS-only end-to-end tests (which need the kernel
Sandbox.kext to enforce the profile) live in test_macos_spawn.py.

Coverage focus matches the spike-validated facts in seatbelt.py:
  * `(allow default)` baseline (not deny-default)
  * ``os.path.realpath()`` applied to write_exceptions paths
  * ``(deny X (require-not (subpath Y)))`` deny-with-exception idiom
  * Audit mode replaces deny with ``(allow X (with report))``
  * Network deny + egress proxy port allowance
