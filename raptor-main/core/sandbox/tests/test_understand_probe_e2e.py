"""End-to-end test for the documented /understand --probe flow.

The MAP-7 step in ``.claude/skills/code-understanding/map.md``
describes a workflow:

  1. operator runs ``/understand --map`` to produce
     ``$WORKDIR/context-map.json`` (a static model of the codebase
     with entry points + sinks + trust boundaries);
  2. operator runs ``raptor-sandbox-observe --json --out $WORKDIR/probe
     -- /path/to/binary [args]`` to produce ``probe.json`` with the
     binary's runtime reach;
  3. operator merges via
     ``core.sandbox.observe_context_merge.merge_observation_into_context_map``;
  4. resulting context-map.json gets a ``runtime_observation`` key
     with correlations against entry points + sinks.

This test runs the FULL flow end-to-end on Linux:

  * builds a synthetic project tree with files corresponding to a
    set of entry points and sinks;
  * spawns ``/bin/cat`` against one of the source files via
    ``sandbox(observe=True)``;
  * loads the resulting profile from JSONL;
  * merges into a synthetic context map with target_dir set;
  * asserts the correlation surfaces the EXPECTED entry point ID
    and not unrelated ones.

Without this test, the merge-utility unit tests cover the dataclass
plumbing but never confirm the full skill workflow produces useful
signal at scale.
