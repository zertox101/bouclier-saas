"""Tests for core.sandbox.ptrace_probe — environment-detection probe.

The probe forks a sentinel child that calls PTRACE_TRACEME and SIGSTOPs
itself; the parent attempts PTRACE_CONT. Tests cover:
- The probe returns SOMETHING coherent on the test host (without hard-
  coding True or False, since CI environments vary).
- The cache layer prevents duplicate probes within a process.
- The degradation warning fires once-per-process when ptrace is blocked.
- Cleanup: probe failures don't leave zombie children.

We deliberately don't assert "ptrace IS available" — the test environment
may not permit it (Yama scope 3, container without SYS_PTRACE, etc.).
What we assert is correctness of the probe's behaviour given whatever
the kernel reports.
