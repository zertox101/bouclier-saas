"""End-to-end tests for `audit_mode=True` in run_sandboxed.

These run the full audit flow:
- Pre-flight ptrace probe.
- Tracer subprocess fork.
- PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY in target preexec.
- Tracer-ready handshake.
- Seccomp filter with SCMP_ACT_TRACE.
- Target executes; tracer logs syscall events to JSONL.
- Parent reaps both target and tracer.
