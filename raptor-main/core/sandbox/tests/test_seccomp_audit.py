"""Tests for core.sandbox.seccomp's audit_mode kwarg.

Audit mode swaps the deny action from SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(EPERM) to
SCMP_ACT_TRACE so the attached ptrace tracer is notified instead of
the syscall failing. Also adds open/openat/connect to the trace set
for b3 filesystem + network audit coverage.

These tests exercise the helpers directly (constants, kwarg shape,
audit_extra resolution). The full live behaviour — installed filter
firing TRACE events, tracer receiving them — needs the spawn
integration in this same commit; the end-to-end test there is the
proof that the wiring works.
