"""Shared mutable module state for the sandbox package.

Centralising these globals in one place means consumers access them via
`from core.sandbox import state; state.<name>` (not `from state import <name>`,
which captures the binding at import time and misses later updates).

What lives here:
- `_cache_lock`: RLock guarding every module-level cache below. RLock (not
  Lock) because check_mount_available() calls check_net_available() while
  holding it.
- Availability caches — `None` = not probed, False/True or ABI version
  once probed. Each `check_*_available()` function populates its cache
  once per process.
- CLI-override flags — set ONLY by argparse-backed entry points, never
  by env/config/target-repo content. This keeps the sandbox unescapable
  by prompt injection.
- Once-per-process WARNING throttles — kernel capability is static, and
  scan loops can open hundreds of sandbox() contexts; we warn once.
