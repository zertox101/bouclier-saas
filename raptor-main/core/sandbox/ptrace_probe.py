"""Detect whether the current process can ptrace its own children.

Foundation for `--audit` modes b2 (syscall audit via SCMP_ACT_TRACE)
and b3 (filesystem audit via syscall interception). Both depend on the
parent being able to PTRACE_SEIZE / PTRACE_TRACEME-with-its-own-children.

What can block ptrace in a Linux environment:
- Yama scope 3 (`/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope == 3`) — disables all
  ptrace, including parent→own-child. Rare; default Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora
  is scope 1 which permits tracing one's own descendants.
- Container `--cap-drop SYS_PTRACE` — Docker default for non-privileged
  containers; widespread.
- Restrictive container seccomp profile — Docker's default profile permits
  ptrace but custom hardened profiles often don't.
- AppArmor / SELinux MAC policy — uncommon outside hardened distros.

The probe forks a sentinel child that calls `PTRACE_TRACEME` and SIGSTOPs
itself. The parent waits for the stop, attempts `PTRACE_CONT` to release
it, and observes whether the syscalls succeeded.

Cached per-process: ptrace availability is a function of the kernel +
container policy, both static across a single RAPTOR run.

**Fork-after-threads caveat.** This probe calls `os.fork()`. By the time
`check_ptrace_available()` is first invoked, the egress proxy daemon
thread (and possibly ThreadPoolExecutor workers) may already be running.
Python 3.12+ emits a DeprecationWarning for fork-after-threads-have-
started because any libc-internal mutex (e.g. malloc lock) held by
another thread at fork-time stays locked in the child with no thread
alive to release it — the child can deadlock if it touches the held
resource.

The probe mitigates this by: (a) caching aggressively (one probe per
process, never re-runs in production); (b) keeping the child code
syscall-only after fork (`libc.ptrace`, `os.kill`, `os._exit`) — no
malloc, no Python-runtime calls beyond the necessary ones. Tests
deliberately invalidate the cache to re-probe; that's the only path
that re-forks, and it runs single-threaded under pytest.

Mirrors the same trade-off as the Landlock probe; conftest snapshots
the relevant state for test isolation.

**Asyncio caveat.** The egress proxy runs an asyncio event loop on a
daemon thread. `os.fork()` from inside an asyncio loop is undefined
behaviour (selectors, file descriptors, callback state can all break).
The probe must be called from the main thread, NOT from inside the
proxy thread or any other coroutine context. In RAPTOR's lifecycle
the probe runs at startup before any sandbox is constructed, so this
constraint is satisfied automatically.

**No waitpid timeout.** The probe blocks indefinitely if the child
fails to stop or exit. In practice this completes in microseconds —
the child's TRACEME + self-SIGSTOP path is short and synchronous.
On a wedged system that can't schedule the probe child within seconds,
the broader sandbox setup is going to have problems anyway. Add a
SIGALRM-based timeout if this ever bites in the field.
