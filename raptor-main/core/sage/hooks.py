    each run `is_available()` (duplicate network calls), and a thread
    can briefly observe a non-None `_client` while another resets it.

    long-lived RAPTOR session (typical: forgot to start the SAGE
    node before `/agentic`, started it mid-run after seeing the
    "SAGE unavailable" log) saw zero recovery — every subsequent
    hook silently no-op'd until the parent process restarted.
