"""Shared helpers for SAGE setup scripts.

Both `register_agents.py` and `seed_sage_knowledge.py` propose a
deterministic set of memories on install. Running them twice (e.g. after
a SAGE volume reset, or when the setup script is re-invoked) creates
duplicates in the SAGE consensus store.

`async_memory_exists` lets callers skip the propose step for items
already stored, keyed by a stable per-memory tag that SAGE's
tags-as-first-class feature makes queryable. (Introduced in SAGE
6.6.0; still present in 8.4.2 — `list_memories(domain, tag, limit=1)`
remains the supported exact-filter lookup, verified against
docs/reference/python-sdk.md.)

Caveat: SAGE stores tags as **node-local metadata** (not part of the
on-chain consensus tx). On a single-node deployment — which is what
`libexec/raptor-sage-setup` spins up by default — submit and query
hit the same node, so tag-based existence checks are reliable. On a
distributed SAGE where submit and query can land on different nodes,
tags would not replicate and re-runs against a fresh node would
duplicate. Not a concern for current RAPTOR deployments.
