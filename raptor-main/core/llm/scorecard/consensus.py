"""Producer wiring for ``EventType.MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS``.

When /agentic dispatches multiple analysis models on the same finding,
post-dispatch correlation tags each finding as ``"high"`` (everyone
agreed exploitable), ``"high-negative"`` (everyone agreed not),
or ``"disputed"`` (split). For disputed findings, this producer
records:

  * each minority model → ``incorrect``
  * each majority model → ``correct``

against the ``(model, decision_class)`` cell, where decision_class is
``agentic:<rule_id>``. Agreed findings produce no signal — they're
useful for downstream confidence math but don't tell us which models
drift from panel consensus over time.

Ties (e.g. 1-vs-1 in a 2-model panel) are skipped: there's no clear
majority and arbitrarily declaring one model wrong would inject noise
into the cell. The cheap-tier ``CHEAP_SHORT_CIRCUIT`` counter is
untouched — this producer feeds its own event slot only and never
shifts the auto-policy gate.

Sister producers in the same family:

  * ``core.llm.scorecard.prefilter`` — ``CHEAP_SHORT_CIRCUIT`` (the
    fast-tier prefilter producer; landed first; drives the
    auto-policy gate).
  * ``core.llm.scorecard.judge`` — ``JUDGE_REVIEW`` (judge model
    overruling primary; landed alongside this).
  * ``core.llm.scorecard.tool_evidence`` — ``TOOL_EVIDENCE``
    (downstream validation back-propagation).

These all use the same ``record_event`` substrate API + same
decision_class shape (``<consumer>:<rule_id>``). Naming and
policy-isolation conventions live here so future producers added to
the family stay in lock-step.

    ``MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS`` event per (model, finding) pair on

    Returns the number of events written.

    No-op when ``scorecard`` is ``None`` (operator opted out via
    ``scorecard_enabled=False`` or the consumer didn't have a
    scorecard available). No-op when ``correlation`` is empty
    (single-model run).

    ``per_finding_results`` (optional): mapping ``{finding_id: [
    per-model result dict, ...]}`` from the orchestrator's
    per-model dispatch. When supplied, the producer captures each
    minority model's OWN reasoning into the disagreement-samples
    log (rather than the primary's, which is misleading attribution).
    Passing ``None`` skips per-model reasoning capture — the cell
    still gets the correct/incorrect counter bumps, just no sample
    text. Decoupled from ``results_by_id`` to avoid mutating the
    primary records the orchestrator later serialises into
    ``orchestrated_report.json``.

    The ``decision_class_prefix`` follows the existing convention —
    ``"agentic"`` for /agentic-dispatched findings, matching the
    prefilter producer's ``agentic:<rule_id>`` cell shape so consensus
    and prefilter signals share the same cell.

    Failure path: any per-event ``record_event`` exception is logged
    at debug level and swallowed; one bad event must not abort the
    whole batch and must never block the calling orchestrator's
    flow. Operators who care will see the per-event log line.
