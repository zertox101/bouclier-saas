"""Producer wiring for ``EventType.REASONING_DIVERGENCE``.

Sister of ``core.llm.scorecard.consensus`` for the ``agreed-verdict``
case. ``consensus`` only fires on disputed findings (split panels);
this producer covers the gap: panels that agreed on the verdict but
their reasoning text diverged. Translation: "everyone said
exploitable, but for noticeably different reasons — the outlier is
the most likely to be right for the wrong reason".

For each ``"high"`` / ``"high-negative"`` finding in the correlation
result:

  * Compute reasoning divergence via :mod:`core.llm.semantic_entropy`.
  * If the metric is ``None`` (panel too small / reasoning too short)
    → skip the finding.
  * If ``mean_pairwise_distance < threshold`` → skip (panel is tight,
    no anomaly to report). The threshold is configurable; default
    ``0.80`` derived from the test-fixture distribution between
    aligned (~0.67) and divergent (~0.91) panels. Operators should
    re-calibrate from real data once a few runs have accumulated.
  * Otherwise: outlier model (farthest reasoning from the rest of
    the panel) → ``incorrect``; the remaining panel members →
    ``correct``.

Disputed findings are skipped — they belong to ``consensus`` and
double-counting them here would inject correlated noise into the
two cells.

Sister producers in the same family:

  * ``core.llm.scorecard.prefilter`` — ``CHEAP_SHORT_CIRCUIT``.
  * ``core.llm.scorecard.consensus`` — ``MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS``
    (disputed-finding sibling of this producer).
  * ``core.llm.scorecard.judge`` — ``JUDGE_REVIEW``.
  * ``core.llm.scorecard.tool_evidence`` — ``TOOL_EVIDENCE``.

These all use the same ``record_event`` substrate API + same
decision_class shape (``<consumer>:<rule_id>``).

Observability-only in v1: no policy gate consumes
``REASONING_DIVERGENCE`` yet. The cell counters accumulate so
operators can query them via ``scorecard cli`` and we can decide
whether to promote any of the deferred policies — see
``project_semantic_entropy`` memory for the three deferred options.

    measure — consensus can still record outcomes because verdicts
    are in the matrix, but divergence needs the text.

    ``per_finding_results``: mapping ``{finding_id: [per-model

    mutate records the orchestrator later serialises into

    Failure path: any per-event ``record_event`` exception is logged
    at debug level and swallowed; one bad event must not abort the
