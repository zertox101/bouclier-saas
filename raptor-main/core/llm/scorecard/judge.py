"""Producer wiring for ``EventType.JUDGE_REVIEW``.

When /agentic dispatches a judge panel (``--judge <model>``,
``--judge <m1> <m2>`` etc.) over the primary's analysis, the
``JudgeTask`` finalises a final verdict by majority vote across
(primary + judges). Disputes — where one or more participants
disagreed — are this producer's signal:

  * Primary's vote != final → primary's model gets ``incorrect``.
  * Primary's vote == final → primary's model gets ``correct``.
  * Each judge's vote vs final → same.

Single-judge mode is INTENTIONALLY SKIPPED. There the ``JudgeTask``
keeps the primary's verdict (``final = primary_exploitable``) and
just flags the dispute for operator review — there's no automated
truth signal worth recording. Multi-judge mode is where the panel
collectively overrules and the producer can attribute correctness.

Agreed findings produce no signal — every model voted the same way
so the cell would just bump uniformly without distinguishing models.
Same skip pattern as ``record_consensus_outcomes``.

Cells are keyed by ``agentic:<rule_id>``, shared with the
multi-model-consensus and prefilter producers; different event
slots (``JUDGE_REVIEW`` vs ``MULTI_MODEL_CONSENSUS`` vs
``CHEAP_SHORT_CIRCUIT``) keep their counters isolated. The
auto-policy gate's Wilson math runs over the cheap-tier slot
only — judge events do NOT shift the prefilter gate.
