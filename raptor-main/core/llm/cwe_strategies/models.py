    """Mechanical heuristics for picking a strategy.

    Each list is scored independently and the totals sum into a
    single strategy score. Higher score = stronger pick.

    Signals (best to weakest, generally):

      * ``cwes`` — exact CWE identifiers attached to the target by
        an upstream classifier (``/agentic`` finding, ``/understand``
        sink type). Direct evidence of the bug class.
      * ``function_calls`` — names of functions called by the
        target. The strongest mechanical signal: a function that
        calls ``mutex_lock`` IS concurrency-relevant regardless of
        path, name, or includes.
      * ``includes`` — header file names referenced by the target.
        Strong signal for C/C++ (``linux/skbuff.h`` → input).
      * ``paths`` — substrings of the target file's path. Broad
        but cheap signal; specificity scoring rewards narrow
        declarations like ``fs/splice.c`` over ``fs/``.
      * ``function_keywords`` — tokens that should appear as
        whole identifier components in the function name. Matched
        with token semantics (split on ``_``/``-``), not raw
        substring, so ``parse`` matches ``parse_packet`` but NOT
        ``is_sparse_array``.

    Matching is case-insensitive throughout.
