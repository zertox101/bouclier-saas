"""Regression test for F085.

`spawn_worker` accepts `env: Optional[Mapping[str, str]] = None`. When
the caller passes `env=None` (either explicitly or by not passing it),
the previous behaviour was:

    base_env = dict(env) if env is not None else {}

i.e. the child got an environment of literally `{}` — no PATH, no
HOME, no LANG, no anything except the two RAPTOR_LLM_* vars added a
few lines below. Most child binaries fail catastrophically without
PATH (`exec` can't locate the binary if it's a wrapper that re-execs),
HOME (process-local config-file resolution explodes), or LANG (Python
text-mode I/O can pick weird encodings).

The fix mirrors `core/sandbox/context.py:890-906` exactly — when env
is None, default to `RaptorConfig.get_safe_env()` (so credentials are
stripped but baseline shell env is preserved).

This test asserts that calling `spawn_worker(..., env=None)` results
in the subprocess receiving a non-empty env containing at least PATH.
We mock the dispatcher and subprocess.Popen so we can introspect what
env was passed to Popen.
