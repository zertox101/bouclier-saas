"""Unix-domain HTTP dispatcher with credential-isolation security layers.

Five security layers, in the order an attacker must defeat them:

  L1. **Filesystem isolation.** Socket lives in a fresh 0700 directory
      created via ``tempfile.mkdtemp``; socket file is 0600. Other
      UIDs cannot traverse into the directory regardless of the
      socket file's mode.
  L2. **Peer-UID verification on every accept.** Linux uses
      ``SO_PEERCRED``, macOS uses ``LOCAL_PEERCRED``. Connections
      from a different UID are dropped before any HTTP parsing.
  L3. **Per-worker capability token, FD-passed.** Each spawned
      worker gets a fresh 32-byte token via inherited file descriptor
      (NOT env var — same-UID processes can read ``/proc/N/environ``
      on Linux). Worker presents the token in the ``X-Raptor-Token``
      header on its first request.
  L4. **Token bounded by request budget + TTL + explicit revocation.**
      Token can establish multiple connections within its budget +
      TTL — required so a worker process that spawns its own
      grandchildren (relayed via :func:`relay_for_grandchild`) can
      share the session without round-tripping the dispatcher for a
      fresh token. Connections after ``request_budget`` requests or
      ``ttl_s`` seconds are rejected; an explicit ``revoke`` flips
      the record to terminal state.
  L5. **Audit log.** Every accept / reject / dispatch event lands
      in a JSONL log. Body content is intentionally never logged.

The dispatcher does NOT terminate TLS, MITM, or read prompt/response
content beyond what's needed to inject the auth header and forward
bytes upstream.
