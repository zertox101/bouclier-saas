"""Worker-side helpers for using the credential-isolation dispatcher.

A worker spawned via :func:`spawn_worker` inherits two pieces of state:

  * ``RAPTOR_LLM_SOCKET`` env var — UDS path of the dispatcher.
  * ``RAPTOR_LLM_TOKEN_FD`` env var — read-end of a pipe with the
    32-byte capability token. Worker must read it before doing any
    other work and close the FD.

This module provides:

  * :func:`read_token` — one-shot read of the token from the inherited
    FD. Worker code calls this exactly once at startup.
  * :func:`make_anthropic_client` — stock ``anthropic.Anthropic``
    client wired to talk HTTP-over-UDS to the dispatcher, with the
    token automatically attached as a header on every request.

Workers don't need a custom SDK shim — the LLM SDKs sit on top of
``httpx`` and accept a custom HTTP client, which is what we provide.
