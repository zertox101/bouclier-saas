"""Spawn helper that wires the dispatcher into ``subprocess.Popen``.

Allocates a worker token via the dispatcher, passes the token's
read-end FD into the child, and sets the corresponding env vars.
The child receives:

  * ``RAPTOR_LLM_SOCKET`` — UDS path of the dispatcher.
  * ``RAPTOR_LLM_TOKEN_FD`` — file descriptor number to read the
    token from.

The worker's environment intentionally does NOT contain any LLM
provider API keys. The dispatcher injects them at request time
from its in-memory secret store.
