"""Provider-agnostic types for the tool-use loop.

This module is the single source of truth for the wire-shapes the
:class:`ToolUseLoop` and any provider implementation pass between
themselves. Every provider in ``core.llm.tool_use.providers`` translates
its native wire format (Anthropic ``tool_use``/``tool_result`` blocks,
OpenAI ``tool_calls``/``role:"tool"`` messages, Gemini's
``function_call``/``function_response``, Ollama's tool-call shape) into
the dataclasses defined here, and back out, on each turn.

Design choices captured here that are easy to miss when reading code
without context:

- ``Message.content`` is heterogeneous (``TextBlock | ToolCall | ToolResult``)
  but the *valid* mix depends on ``role`` — assistant turns may carry text
  + tool_calls, user turns may carry text + tool_results. Type-checking
  this strictly (``AssistantContent`` / ``UserContent`` newtypes) was
  considered and rejected: the conversion code in each provider already
  validates per-role, and lifting the constraint into the type system
  pushes complexity to every consumer with no real win.

- Tool ``handler`` is sync-only. Async / cancellation come via a parallel
  ``AsyncToolUseLoop`` if/when a real consumer needs it. Wrapping
  long-running work with ``tool_timeout_s`` at the loop level is the
  v1 escape hatch.

- ``StopReason`` is a provider-agnostic enum, not a string union. Each
  provider maps its native vocabulary onto these five values; the loop
  consumes the enum directly. Anthropic-only literals were deliberately
  rejected so multi-provider downstreams don't silently drift.

- ``CacheControl`` is per-region opt-in (system / tools /
  history-through-index) rather than a single bool. This matches
  Anthropic's actual cache-breakpoint semantics; providers that don't
  support caching ignore it entirely (capability flag is False, the
  loop still passes the struct through unchanged).
