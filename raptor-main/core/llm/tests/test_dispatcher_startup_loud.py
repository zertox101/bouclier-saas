"""Pin that ``raptor._get_or_start_dispatcher`` surfaces failures
loudly on stderr — Phase C activation step 1.

The dispatcher's startup failure used to be a silent
``logger.warning`` that operators would only see if they had
log-level configured. Today (post-step-1) it also writes a
single-line message to stderr at the moment of failure, so
operators see the failure regardless of log config.

Why this matters: once Phase C activation strips API keys from
``RaptorConfig.get_llm_env``, the env-direct fallback that
``_get_or_start_dispatcher → None`` falls through to will
produce workers WITHOUT auth. The symptom shifts from "dispatcher
silently absent, env-direct works fine" to "dispatcher silently
absent, worker fails 30 seconds later on its first LLM call".
Step 1 makes the underlying root cause visible at the moment it
happens.
