"""Unsat-core helpers: name which constraints contradict.

When a solver returns ``unsat`` after asserting a batch of constraints,
Z3's ``unsat_core()`` tells us which tracked assertions it used to
derive the contradiction — a subset (not always minimal) that is itself
unsatisfiable. That turns "some of these conflict" into "specifically X
contradicts Y", which is stronger evidence for Stage-E chain_breaks than
a generic "mutually exclusive" note.

Usage::

    rev = track(solver, [(name, expr), ...])
    if solver.check() == z3.unsat:
        print(core_names(solver, rev))

    """Assert each labelled expression via ``assert_and_track``.

    Returns a mapping from the generated Z3 label identifier back to the
    caller's human-readable name, used by ``core_names`` to translate
    ``solver.unsat_core()`` output.  Existing (non-tracked) assertions on
    the solver are unaffected and will not appear in the unsat core.

    Pass an existing ``rev`` dict to chain multiple batches on
    the same solver safely — the label counter is derived from
    ``len(rev)`` so new labels never collide with previously
    tracked ones.  When ``rev`` is ``None`` (default) a fresh
    dict is created, matching the original single-call behaviour.

    Per-call UUID prefix on label names: Z3 maintains a process-wide
    hash-cons table for symbolic constants, so two ``track`` calls
    against *different* solver instances that both name a label
    ``_c0`` actually share the same z3 ``BoolRef`` — solver B's
    `assert_and_track(expr_B, label)` poisons solver A's tracking
    (the underlying label object is shared; solver A's `unsat_core()`
    then surfaces a label name from solver B's call, and `rev.get(...)`
    returns the wrong human-readable name or ``None``). Pre-fix this
    only manifested when two solvers ran concurrently or when a test
    re-used label names across solver instances. The UUID prefix
    makes every ``track`` call mint fresh, collision-free labels
    regardless of how many solver instances exist in the process.

    #   the unusual "carry rev across calls" pattern, but the bug
    #   was real).
    # * Operators reading the label name in error logs saw an
    #   index that depended on the dict's current size, not the
    #   per-batch position — confusing because two re-runs of the
    #   same batch produced different labels depending on what
