    #
    #   * `OSError: libz3.so.4 cannot open shared object file`
    #     (system Z3 library mismatched against the wheel
    #     bundled with z3-solver — common after distro
    #     upgrades).

    #     where the wheel's prebuilt binary is incompatible
    #     (musl/Alpine vs the manylinux wheel).
    #   * `ImportError` re-raised from a transitive deep dep
    #     (caught by the outer `Exception` arm only on
    #     unusual stack-walks; normally caught above).

    # In every case, SMT-dependent features (CodeQL dataflow
    # path-feasibility, exploit_feasibility one-gadget SMT)

    # validation when they aren't.

    # Log at WARNING so it lands in the operator's terminal
    # and `out/<run>/raptor.log`. The `exc_info=True` keeps
    # the original traceback for diagnosis (a wheel/lib
