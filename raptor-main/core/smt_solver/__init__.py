"""SMT solver framework for RAPTOR.

A thin, optional Z3 harness shared by domain encoders in ``packages/``.
Handles availability gating, bitvector primitives, signed/unsigned
comparison routing, witness extraction, and solver construction with a
default timeout.

Encoders parametrise width and signedness via ``BVProfile`` — one
handle instead of two flags, with pre-made profiles for common
architecture and C-type flavours (``BV_X86_64``, ``BV_C_UINT32``,
``BV_C_INT32``, ...).

C-semantics primitives (overflow predicates, width coercion, shift
disambiguators, casts) live in ``core.smt_solver.csem`` and are
imported directly by encoders that need them; they're deliberately not
re-exported here to keep the top-level surface small.

Domain-specific encodings (sanitizer patterns, integer overflow
predicates, one-gadget constraints, ...) live in their respective
``packages/`` modules and import primitives from here.
