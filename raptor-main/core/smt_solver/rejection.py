"""Structured rejection reasons for SMT encoder parsers.

When a domain encoder (``smt_path_validator``, ``smt_onegadget``) can't
turn a constraint string into a Z3 expression, the failure is recorded
as a :class:`Rejection` rather than just a textual entry in an
``unknown`` list.  The :class:`RejectionKind` tells callers — and the
LLM that produced the text — *why* the parse failed, so the long tail
of unparseable inputs can be retried with a rephrasing or fed back as
schema feedback rather than disappearing into a bag of strings.

Each domain encoder result keeps its existing ``unknown: List[str]``
field for backwards compatibility and adds a parallel
``unknown_reasons: List[Rejection]`` carrying the structured form.

This module also hosts the small set of helpers every encoder needs to
*build* and *route* rejections so future encoders pick them up for free
instead of cloning the logic:

- :func:`propagate` — re-anchor a sub-expression's rejection on its
  parent's full input text.
- :func:`parse_literal_value` — validate a hex/decimal literal against
  the active :class:`BVProfile`, returning the int or a structured
  :class:`Rejection` (out-of-range, leading-zero ambiguity, or
  unrecognised shape).
- :func:`classify_solver_unknown` — translate Z3's ``reason_unknown()``
  string into ``SOLVER_TIMEOUT`` vs ``SOLVER_UNKNOWN``.

    """Why the parser refused to encode a constraint.

    `str+Enum` mixin: instances ARE strings, so ``str(rk)`` and

    after a JSON round-trip
    (``json.dumps(rk)`` -> ``"lex_empty"`` -> ``json.loads`` ->
    plain ``str``), the loaded value is a bare string, not the
    enum member. Comparisons must use ``==`` (which works because
    ``str.__eq__`` compares values), NOT ``is`` (which compares
    object identity and the post-JSON value is a freshly-allocated
    str). Callers that match against `RejectionKind` values across
    serialisation boundaries should:

      * use ``rk == RejectionKind.LEX_EMPTY`` (correct), OR
      * coerce on load via ``RejectionKind(s)`` to get the canonical
        member back.
