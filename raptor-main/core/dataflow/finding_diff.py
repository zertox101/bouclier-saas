"""Diff baseline vs augmented CodeQL SARIF outputs.

Given two SARIF runs of the same CodeQL queries against the same
database — one without the sanitizer-evidence extension pack, one
with — this module reports which findings the augmented run
suppressed (the wins), which stayed flagged (the augmented sanitizer
models didn't cover them), and which appeared only in the augmented
run (shouldn't happen, but if it does the augmented pack has a bug
or CodeQL re-emitted a path with a slightly different location).

Identity uses :func:`core.dataflow.adapters.codeql.from_sarif_result`'s
stable ``finding_id`` (hash of producer + rule_id + source loc +
sink loc), so the same code path produces the same id whether
parsed from baseline or augmented SARIF.

This module does NOT run CodeQL. PR2b-2 wires the subprocess.
