# RAPTOR - Autonomous Offensive/Defensive Research Framework

Safe operations (install, scan, read, generate): DO IT.
Dangerous operations (apply patches, delete, git push): ASK FIRST.

---

## SESSION START

**On first message:**
VERY IMPORTANT: follow these steps in order.
1. Read `.startup-output` using the Read tool, then output its contents verbatim as a fenced code block (``` with no language tag). Do NOT paraphrase or reformat. (The SessionStart hook generates this file automatically before your first message.)
2. On a single line, output "Quick commands:" then list the /agentic, /scan, /fuzz, /web commands (don't explain what they do) and note /commands for the full list.
3. If the `sage_inception` tool is present in your available MCP tools, load `core/sage/CLAUDE.md` (persistent-memory workflow). If absent, SAGE is not installed — skip silently and do not mention it.

---

## EXECUTION RULES

When a skill, command file, or user message specifies a literal command (`Execute: foo`, a fenced shell block as the action, or "run X"), execute it verbatim. Do not add pipes (`| tail`, `| head`, `| grep`), redirects (`2>&1`, `>/dev/null`), flags (`--verbose`, `-q`), wrappers (`timeout`, `nice`), or `cd` prefixes.
RAPTOR pipelines emit progress lines, real-time cost tracking, and the `OUTPUT_DIR=<path>` sentinel that downstream lifecycle steps parse. Truncating or filtering that stream breaks both operator visibility and orchestration.

Exception: when the skill itself shows the modification (e.g. a documented `| tee logfile` pattern), follow what the skill prints.

---

## SLASH-COMMAND DISPATCH

When a `/command` fires:

1. Read `.claude/commands/<name>.md` frontmatter.
2. If `dispatch: <command-line>`: substitute placeholders (operator arguments verbatim; `$OUTPUT_DIR` from RUN LIFECYCLE; `$TARGET_PATH` from DEFAULT TARGET DIRECTORY), then run the substituted command. EXECUTION RULES apply — no pipes / flags / wrappers added.
3. If `dispatch: skill`: this is a multi-step workflow. Follow the body of the .md; there is no single libexec to run.
4. Operator arguments pass through **verbatim**. If a subcommand isn't in the .md's documented surface, run it anyway and let the dispatch's own error surface. Do NOT silently rewrite to a similar subcommand.
5. Never infer the dispatch from the description or from training-memory. The .md is authoritative; CI (`.github/scripts/check_command_metadata.py`) enforces every command has a parseable `dispatch:` field whose target exists on disk.

---

## COMMANDS

/project - Project management: create, list, status, coverage, findings, diff, merge, report, clean, export
/scan /fuzz /web /agentic /codeql /analyze - Security testing
/exploit /patch - Generate PoCs and fixes (beta)
/validate - Exploitability validation pipeline (see below)
/understand - Code understanding: map attack surface, trace flows, hunt variants (see below)
/diagram - Generate Mermaid visual maps from /understand or /validate output (see below)
/annotate - Per-function prose annotations (manual or LLM-emitted) attached to source files

**Coverage:** When asked about coverage, run `libexec/raptor-coverage-summary` (no args = active project). Use `--detailed` for per-file table, `--gaps` for unreviewed functions. See `.claude/skills/coverage.md` for mark/unmark and the full API.

**Note:** `/agentic` runs scan → dedup → prep → analysis (with validation methodology). Use `--sequential` to bypass parallel orchestration. Use `--understand` to pre-map the codebase before scanning, and `--validate` to run the full validation pipeline on exploitable findings afterwards. Both flags are opt-in. Multi-model: `--model` is repeatable — multiple models each independently analyse every finding, then results are correlated; `--consensus`, `--judge`, and `--aggregate` add optional review/synthesis models.
/crash-analysis - Autonomous crash root-cause analysis (see below)
/oss-forensics - GitHub forensic investigation (see below)
/scorecard - Inspect per-model reliability across decision classes; ask natural-language questions about which model is good at what (see below)
/create-skill - Save approaches (alpha)

---

## PROJECTS

Projects are opt-in named workspaces that corral analysis runs into a shared directory. Commands with `--project <name>` or after `/project use <name>` write output to the project directory. Without a project, commands behave as before (timestamped dirs under `out/`).

```
/project create myapp --target /path/to/code -d "Description"
/project use myapp
/scan                          # output goes to project dir
/project status                # shows all runs
/project findings              # shows merged findings across runs
/project coverage              # shows tool coverage summary
/project report                # merged view across all runs
/project correlate             # cross-run finding correlation
/project binary add <path>     # persist a debug binary for binary-oracle enrichment
/project binary list           # list persisted binaries on the active project
/project binary remove <path>  # remove one
/project binary clear          # clear all
/project clean --keep 3        # delete old runs
/project none                  # clear active project
```

See `/project help` for full command list.

---

## DEFAULT TARGET DIRECTORY

When a command like `/scan`, `/agentic`, `/validate`, `/codeql`, or `/fuzz` is run **without a path argument**, resolve the default target in this order:

1. **Active project target:** the run lifecycle script reads the `.active` symlink to find the project target automatically
2. **Caller's directory:** if `$RAPTOR_CALLER_DIR` is set (launcher saves the user's cwd before switching to the RAPTOR repo dir), use it
3. **Ask the user** for the target path

Do not use the current working directory as a fallback — it is always the RAPTOR repo dir, not the user's target. Do not use any of these if the user already specified a path.

---

## RUN LIFECYCLE

When running any analysis command (`/scan`, `/validate`, `/understand`, `/codeql`, `/fuzz`, `/web`), use the run lifecycle stubs to create the output directory and track status:

**Before starting work:**
```bash
libexec/raptor-run-lifecycle start <command> --target <resolved_target> [--out <dir>]
```
Always pass `--target` with the resolved target path (see DEFAULT TARGET DIRECTORY for resolution order). Optionally pass `--out <dir>` to use a specific output directory. The last line of output is `OUTPUT_DIR=<path>` — use that path for all subsequent output files.

**After successful completion:**
```bash
libexec/raptor-run-lifecycle complete "$OUTPUT_DIR"
```

**On failure:**
```bash
libexec/raptor-run-lifecycle fail "$OUTPUT_DIR" "error description"
```

The `start` command automatically resolves the output directory using the active project (via `.active` symlink) or the default `out/` directory. Do not construct output paths manually.

**If `start` fails (non-zero exit):** STOP. Report the error to the user. Do not proceed with the command.

**Note:** `/validate` uses `libexec/raptor-validation-helper 0` instead of `raptor-run-lifecycle` — it bundles lifecycle management with inventory building.

Commands run via `python3 raptor.py` (scan, agentic, codeql, fuzz, web) manage lifecycle internally — do not call the stubs separately for those.

### Coverage tracking

The coverage tracking plugin (`plugins/coverage/`) tracks which source files the LLM reads during analysis via a PostToolUse hook. Loaded automatically by the launcher. Logs file paths to a manifest in the active run directory, converted to `coverage-record.json` when the run completes. Zero overhead when no run is active.

---

## SECURITY: UNTRUSTED REPOS

When scanning untrusted repositories:

- **Environment sanitisation**: `RaptorConfig.get_safe_env()` strips environment variables that tools may shell-evaluate (`TERMINAL`, `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, `BROWSER`, `PAGER`). Always use `get_safe_env()` when spawning subprocesses.
- **File path injection**: Never interpolate file paths from scanned repos into shell command strings. Use list-based `subprocess` arguments.

---

## OUTPUT STYLE

**Status values:**
- In JSON: snake_case (`exploitable`, `confirmed`, `ruled_out`, `disproven`)
- In human-readable output (reports, terminal): Title Case (`Exploitable`, `Confirmed`, `Ruled Out`)
- Never ALL_CAPS (`EXPLOITABLE`, `CONFIRMED`, `RULED_OUT`)

**No red/green status indicators:**
- Do not use 🔴/🟢 - perspective-dependent (bad for defenders ≠ bad for researchers)
- Other emojis are fine (⚠️, ✓, etc.)

---

## CRASH ANALYSIS

The `/crash-analysis` command provides autonomous root-cause analysis for C/C++ crashes.

**Usage:** `/crash-analysis <bug-tracker-url> <git-repo-url>`

**Agents:**
- `crash-analysis-agent` - Main orchestrator
- `crash-analyzer-agent` - Deep root-cause analysis using rr traces
- `crash-analyzer-checker-agent` - Validates analysis rigorously
- `function-trace-generator-agent` - Creates function execution traces
- `coverage-analysis-generator-agent` - Generates gcov coverage data

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/crash-analysis/`):
- `rr-debugger` - Deterministic record-replay debugging
- `function-tracing` - Function instrumentation with -finstrument-functions
- `gcov-coverage` - Code coverage collection
- `line-execution-checker` - Fast line execution queries

**Requirements:** rr, gcc/clang (with ASAN), gdb, gcov

---

## OSS FORENSICS

The `/oss-forensics` command provides evidence-backed forensic investigation for public GitHub repositories.

**Usage:** `/oss-forensics <prompt> [--max-followups 3] [--max-retries 3]`

**Agents:**
- `oss-forensics-agent` - Main orchestrator
- `oss-investigator-gh-archive-agent` - Queries GH Archive via BigQuery
- `oss-investigator-github-agent` - Queries live GitHub API
- `oss-investigator-wayback-agent` - Recovers deleted content (Wayback/commits)
- `oss-investigator-local-git-agent` - Analyzes cloned repos for dangling commits
- `oss-investigator-ioc-extractor-agent` - Extracts IOCs from vendor reports
- `oss-hypothesis-former-agent` - Forms evidence-backed hypotheses
- `oss-evidence-verifier-agent` - Verifies evidence via `store.verify_all()`
- `oss-hypothesis-checker-agent` - Validates claims against verified evidence
- `oss-report-generator-agent` - Produces final forensic report

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/oss-forensics/`):
- `github-archive` - GH Archive BigQuery queries
- `github-evidence-kit` - Evidence collection, storage, verification
- `github-commit-recovery` - Recover deleted commits
- `github-wayback-recovery` - Recover content from Wayback Machine

**Requirements:** `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for BigQuery

**Output:** `.out/oss-forensics-<timestamp>/forensic-report.md`

---

## EXPLOITABILITY VALIDATION

The `/validate` command validates that vulnerability findings are real, reachable, and exploitable.

**Usage:** `/validate <target_path> [--vuln-type <type>] [--findings <file>]`

**Stages:** 0 → A → B → C → D → E → F → 1 (see `.claude/skills/exploitability-validation/PIPELINE.md`)

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/exploitability-validation/`):
- `PIPELINE.md` - Stage naming convention (letters = LLM, numbers = mechanical)
- `SKILL.md` - Shared context, gates, execution rules
- `stage-0-inventory.md` through `stage-1-outputs.md` - Stage instructions

**Output:** `out/exploitability-validation-<timestamp>/validation-report.md`

**Pipeline handoff:** For `/understand` → `/validate` workflows, use the same `--out` directory so `context-map.json`, `checklist.json`, and `flow-trace-*.json` are shared automatically.

---

## CODE UNDERSTANDING

The `/understand` command provides deep, adversarial code comprehension for security research.

**Usage:** `/understand <target> [--map] [--trace <entry>] [--hunt <pattern>] [--teach <subject>] [--out <dir>]`

**Modes:**
- `--map` — Build context: entry points, trust boundaries, sinks → `context-map.json`
- `--trace <entry>` — Follow one data flow source → sink with full call chain → `flow-trace-<id>.json`
- `--hunt <pattern>` — Find all variants of a pattern across the codebase → `variants.json`
- `--teach <subject>` — Explain a framework, library, or pattern in depth (inline)

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/code-understanding/`):
- `SKILL.md` — Gates, config, output format
- `map.md` — Entry point enumeration, trust boundary mapping, sink catalog
- `trace.md` — Step-by-step data flow tracing with branch coverage
- `hunt.md` — Structural, semantic, and root-cause variant analysis
- `teach.md` — Framework/pattern explanation with security conclusion

**Output:** Resolved by `libexec/raptor-run-lifecycle start understand` (project dir or `out/understand_<timestamp>/`)

**Pipeline integration:** `/validate` Stage 0 automatically imports `/understand` output via the bridge (`core/orchestration/understand_bridge.py`). No `--out` alignment needed — the bridge searches: (1) co-located files, (2) project siblings, (3) global `out/` by target path + SHA-256 freshness. When found, it pre-populates `attack-surface.json`, imports flow traces as attack paths, and marks entry points/sinks as high-priority in the checklist.

---

## DIAGRAM GENERATION

The `/diagram` command generates Mermaid visual maps from `/understand` and `/validate` JSON outputs, giving researchers a visual representation of code flows, sources, sinks, trust boundaries, attack trees, and attack paths. Consider this 
very much a WIP but it could be of use for those wanting to see relationships and flows better. 

**Usage:** `/diagram <out-dir> [--target <name>] [--type context-map|flow-trace|attack-tree|attack-paths|all]`

**What gets rendered:**
- `context-map.json` → flowchart LR: entry points → trust boundaries → sinks; unchecked flows as dashed edges
- `attack-surface.json` → same layout (Stage B equivalent view)
- `flow-trace-*.json` → flowchart TD per trace: each hop in the call chain, tainted variables, branches, attacker control summary
- `attack-tree.json` → flowchart TD: knowledge graph nodes styled by status (confirmed/disproven/exploring/unexplored)
- `attack-paths.json` → flowchart TD per path: step chain with proximity score and blocker annotations

**Output:** `diagrams.md` written into the target directory (or `--stdout` to print)

**Implementation:** `libexec/raptor-render-diagrams <out-dir> [--target <name>]`

**When to run:** Diagrams are auto-generated at the end of `/validate` and `/understand --map`/`--trace`. Use `/diagram <dir>` to re-render after manual edits to JSON outputs.

---

## ANNOTATIONS

The `/annotate` command attaches free-form prose to individual functions, stored as markdown mirroring the source tree. Operators write manual review notes; LLM passes (`/agentic`, `/understand`) emit per-function annotations automatically.

**Storage:** `<base>/<source_path>.md` — one annotation file per source file, with `## function_name` sections, an HTML-comment metadata line, and a free-form prose body. The base directory defaults to the active project's `<output_dir>/annotations`.

**Status enum:** `clean` (reviewed, no concern) / `suspicious` (real bug, not exploitable) / `finding` (exploitable) / `entry_point` / `sink` / `trust_boundary` / `flow_step` / `unchecked_flow` / `error`.

**Source attribution:** Every annotation carries `metadata.source=human` or `metadata.source=llm`. LLM-driven writes pass `overwrite=respect-manual` so a manual operator note is never silently clobbered. Operators using `/annotate add` set `source=human` by default.

**Staleness:** Annotations stamped with `--lines N-M` carry a `metadata.hash` short prefix of the function's source. `/annotate stale` re-computes and lists annotations whose source has drifted.

**Where annotations come from:**
- `/agentic` — emits one annotation per analysed finding under `<run_output_dir>/annotations/`. Status mapped from the LLM's `is_true_positive` × `is_exploitable`. Body is the LLM's `reasoning`.
- `/understand --map` / `--trace` — post-processor synthesises annotations for entry points, sinks, trust boundaries, unchecked flows, and per-step trace records.
- `/annotate add` — operator-driven manual entry.

**Operator workflow:**
```
/annotate add src/auth.py check_pw --status clean -m "Constant-time compare, no taint"
/annotate ls --status finding              # cross-run view in active project
/annotate show src/auth.py check_pw
/annotate edit src/auth.py check_pw        # opens .md in $EDITOR
/annotate stale --target ~/repos/myproj    # source drifted since note written
```

**Substrate:** `core/annotations/` — atomic write via tempfile + rename, path-traversal defended (rejects `..` segments and absolute paths), function-name and metadata-value validation prevents on-disk format corruption.

---

## PROGRESSIVE LOADING

**When scan completes:** Load `tiers/analysis-guidance.md` (adversarial thinking)
**When validating exploitability:** Load `.claude/skills/exploitability-validation/SKILL.md` (gates, methodology)
**When validation errors occur:** Load `tiers/validation-recovery.md` (stage-specific recovery)
**When developing exploits:** Load `tiers/exploit-guidance.md` (constraints, techniques)
**When errors occur:** Load `tiers/recovery.md` (recovery protocol)
**When requested:** Load `tiers/personas/[name].md` (expert personas)
**When running /understand:** Load `.claude/skills/code-understanding/SKILL.md` (gates, config) plus the relevant mode file: `map.md`, `trace.md`, `hunt.md`, or `teach.md`

---

## BINARY ANALYSIS

**Flow: Find vulnerabilities FIRST, then check exploitability.**

1. **Analyze the binary** - Find vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format strings, etc.)
2. **If vulnerabilities found** - Run exploit feasibility analysis (MANDATORY)

```python
from packages.exploit_feasibility.api import analyze_binary, format_analysis_summary

# MANDATORY: Run this after finding vulnerabilities
result = analyze_binary('/path/to/binary')
print(format_analysis_summary(result, verbose=True))
```

**DO NOT use checksec or readelf instead** - they miss critical constraints like:
- Empirical %n verification (glibc may block it)
- Null byte constraints from strcpy (can't write 64-bit addresses)
- ROP gadget quality (0 usable gadgets = no ROP chain)
- Input handler bad bytes
- Full RELRO blocks .fini_array too (not just GOT)

**The `exploitation_paths` section tells you if code execution is actually possible** given the system's mitigations (glibc version, RELRO, etc.).

**SMT integration (optional, requires `pip install z3-solver`):**

Two places Z3 is used — both degrade gracefully when absent:

1. **Binary / one-gadget** (`packages/exploit_feasibility/smt_onegadget.py`): checks
   whether a one-gadget's register/memory constraints are satisfiable given a crash
   state. Result in `exploitation_paths[vuln].one_gadget_info.smt_feasibility`.

2. **CodeQL dataflow** (`packages/codeql/smt_path_validator.py`): checks whether the
   branch conditions along a dataflow path are jointly satisfiable. `unsat` → false
   positive, skip LLM. `sat` → concrete input values fed into the LLM prompt and
   `DataflowValidation.prerequisites`. Best coverage: CWE-190, CWE-120/122,
   CWE-193, CWE-476.

---

## BINARY-ORACLE REACHABILITY

Default behaviour (no flags): /agentic and /codeql auto-detect debug binaries under common build dirs, filter to **locally-built only** (untracked by git — committed binaries are dropped as unverified provenance), and use them to suppress dead-code findings. Pass `--no-binary-oracle` to opt out. When `--binary <path>` is passed explicitly, RAPTOR joins the source inventory with the debug binary via DWARF + nm and annotates each native (C/C++/Rust/Go) function with a per-binary verdict:

- `symbol_present` / `inlined` / `folded` — the function survived compilation in some form
- `absent` — the compiler / linker removed it from the analysed binary

`absent` is corpus-earned for suppression: **1952/1952 verdicts correct across 6 iteratively-tuned corpora (consistency) + 187/187 on the held-out zstd v1.5.6 corpus with NO classifier tuning (generalization)** — rule-of-three 95% UB on miss rate ≤1.6% on first-contact-with-unseen-data. The held-out is non-vacuous: 473/1431 functions exercised by the workload, zero `absent` verdicts on actually-live functions. Conditional on full-DWARF evidence — a stripped binary in the analysed set downgrades to `tier="symbol_only"` and the chokepoint refuses to suppress.

The verdict flows through the existing reachability chokepoint: /codeql + /agentic skip LLM analysis on absent-function findings (pre-LLM hard-suppress); /validate's demoter clamps attack-path proximity; /understand --map annotates entry-points and sinks with the per-binary verdict + tier.

**Operator usage**:
- (default, no flags) — auto-detect runs, filters to locally-built binaries (git-untracked) only, soft hint when nothing found.
- `--binary <path>` — pass an explicit debug binary. Repeatable for hybrid targets. Path validated at parse time. Bypasses the git-tracked filter (operator asserts trust). Suppresses default auto-detect.
- `--binary-auto` — same auto-detect + git-filter logic as the default-on path, but with a louder "nothing found" message. Honours `--target-kind`. Warns when the result cap (8) is reached. Auto-detected dirs: `build/`, `target/release/`, `cmake-build-*/`, `bazel-bin/`, `builddir/`, `Debug/`, `Release/`, `out/`, `dist/`, `bin/`, Rust `target/<triple>/release` cross-target globs, and the source root.
- `--no-binary-oracle` — disable binary-oracle filtering entirely for this run. Use for library-only targets with no main binary, runs where you want every finding unfiltered for review, or when a build mismatch is causing over-suppression. Overrides `--binary` / `--binary-auto` with a stderr warning if combined.
- `--binary-edges` — Inc 2b Tier 1/2: extract direct call edges + vtable resolution via r2 (single-invocation script-file mode; cached per-build-id with cross-target collision check). Slow (~10-30s per binary, then cached). Required for the `binary_call_edge` REACHABLE promote witness (rescues functions the source-graph thought were dead).
- For `--target-kind=hybrid` deployments (library + application both shipped), declare MULTIPLE binaries — a function is `absent` only when EVERY declared binary lacks it. Tier-weighted combine: when full-DWARF and symbol-only disagree, full-DWARF wins (`alive-in-any` rule only applies same-tier).

**Persistent per-project config**:
- `/project binary add <path>` — persist a binary path on the active project. Auto-loaded by every subsequent /agentic / /codeql / /validate run. `is_file()`-validated at add time.
- `/project binary list` / `remove` / `clear` — manage the persisted list.

**Audit trail**:
- `suppressions.jsonl` is written to the run's output directory whenever the chokepoint hard-suppresses a finding. One JSON record per suppression with `finding_id`, `rule_id`, `file_path`, `line`, `function`, `verdict`, `reason`. Query with `jq -c . suppressions.jsonl`. Both /agentic and /codeql write to the same file shape.
- The classifier's per-finding analysis record also carries `analysis.reachability_suppression: true` + `analysis.reachability_verdict: <verdict>` for per-finding inspection.

**Defenses against hostile / wrong-binary scenarios**:
- Provenance gate on auto-detect: binaries tracked by git (committed to the source tree) are dropped — only locally-built artifacts (untracked files under build/, target/release/, etc.) feed the oracle. Defends against attacker-planted binaries and stale committed pre-builds that would silently steer `absent` verdicts toward suppressing real findings. Operator can bypass via explicit `--binary <path>` when they know a tracked binary is trustworthy.
- Source-coverage floor (≥5% of project source names matched, min 3 matched, kicks in at ≥8 project names) — a planted ELF unrelated to source gets dropped with a loud warning rather than driving every source function to `absent`.
- Sandbox isolation: r2 runs under `core.sandbox.run` (namespace + Landlock + network deny); binutils tools (readelf, nm, objdump, c++filt) under `core.sandbox.run_trusted`.

**E2E + precision verification**:
- `libexec/raptor-binary-oracle-e2e` — single-invocation audit that builds a real C target and walks 15 consumer surfaces (54 assertions). No LLM calls. Run via `bin/raptor` or `CLAUDECODE=1 libexec/...`.
- `libexec/raptor-binary-oracle-precision --corpus <name>` — re-measure absent-precision on any corpus driver (synthetic/zlib/libsodium/snappy/leveldb/regex-rust/zstd_holdout). Report includes per-corpus cross-tab (classifier × gcov live/dead), aggregate with rule-of-three UB, n-concentration dominator detection, and the toolchain block (cc/gcov/llvm-cov versions) so the precision number is reproducible.

**Skill location**: `core/inventory/binary_oracle.py` (classifier), `core/inventory/binary_oracle_autodetect.py` (auto-detect), `core/inventory/binary_oracle_precision.py` (measurement harness — `libexec/raptor-binary-oracle-precision` CLI shim runs it). Design + validation writeup: `~/design/binary-oracle-reachability.md` §9-11.

## EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT

**Verify constraints BEFORE attempting any technique.** Many hours are wasted on architecturally impossible approaches.

**MANDATORY: Check `exploitation_paths` verdict first:**
- Unlikely = no known path, suggest environment changes
- Difficult = primitives exist but hard to chain, be honest about challenges
- Likely exploitable = good chance, proceed with suggested techniques

**Follow the chain_breaks** - these tell you exactly what WON'T work.
**Follow the what_would_help** - these tell you what MIGHT work.

**ALWAYS offer next steps, even for Difficult/Unlikely verdicts:**
- Try alternative targets (if available)
- Focus on info leaks only
- Run in older environment (Docker)
- Move on to other targets

**Never just stop** - let the user decide how to proceed.

See `tiers/exploit-guidance.md` for detailed constraint tables and technique alternatives.

## STRUCTURE

Python orchestrates everything. Claude shows results concisely.
Never circumvent Python execution flow.
- never disclose remote OLLAMA server location in code, comments, logs etc
- **Python path safety:** Never add anything to `sys.path` except `os.environ["RAPTOR_DIR"]`. Use the hard lookup (KeyError if unset) — no fallbacks, no `'.'`, no `os.getcwd()`, no hardcoded paths. The `libexec/` scripts handle their own path setup via `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` and do not need `RAPTOR_DIR`.
